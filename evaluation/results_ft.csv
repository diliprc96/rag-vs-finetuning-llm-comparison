finetuned,9,explanation,Why does a passenger in a turning car feel pushed to the side?,"{""result"": ""The passenger in a turning car feels pushed to the side due to the Coriolis force. The Coriolis force is an inertial force that causes objects to rotate in a counterclockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and a clockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere.
