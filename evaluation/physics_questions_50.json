    "question": "Why does a passenger in a turning car feel pushed to the side?",
    "answer": "This is due to basic inertia (Newton's First Law). The passenger's body tends to continue moving in a straight line, while the car turns. The sensation of being pushed outward is a 'fictitious force' (centrifugal force) experienced in the non-inertial reference frame of the car."

    "type": "explanation",
    "question": "Explain why static friction is usually greater than kinetic friction.",
    "answer": "Static friction arises from the interlocking of irregularities and molecular bonds between surfaces at rest, requiring more force to break them ('cold welding'). Kinetic friction occurs when surfaces are already sliding, where the contact points don't have enough time to bond as strongly."

    "type": "explanation",
    "question": "Why is banking of roads used on curves?",

    "type": "explanation",
    "question": "Differentiate between conservative and non-conservative forces.",
    "answer": "A conservative force (like gravity) does work that is independent of the path taken; energy used against it is stored as potential energy and is recoverable. A non-conservative force (like friction) depends on the path, and work done dissipates mechanical energy into heat."

    "type": "explanation",
    "question": "Why can we not use the kinematic equations (suvat) for a spring-mass system oscillating?",
    "answer": "Kinematic equations (like $v = u + at$) assume *constant* acceleration. In a spring-mass system ($F = -kx$), the force and thus acceleration varies with position ($a$ is not constant), so those specific equations are invalid. We must use simple harmonic motion equations."

    "answer": "The period remains unchanged. The period of a simple pendulum $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{L/g}$ depends only on length $L$ and gravity $g$. Mass cancels out in the derivation because both the restoring force (gravity) and the inertia (mass) scale linearly with mass."

By increasing $\\Delta t$ for the same $\\Delta p$, the average force $F$ exerted on the passenger is significantly reduced, minimizing injury."
