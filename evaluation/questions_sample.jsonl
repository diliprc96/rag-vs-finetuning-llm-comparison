{"id": 4, "type": "explain", "question": "Why does a satellite in circular orbit have constant speed but changing velocity?", "gold": "Speed constant because magnitude of velocity unchanged; direction changes due to centripetal acceleration toward center; velocity vector rotates.", "reference": "OpenStax Ch.5: Circular motion and gravitation."}
