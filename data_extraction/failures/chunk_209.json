    "input": "",
    "output": "The text states that in this section, the focus is on "looking at some convenient equations for kinematic relationships" and investigating "the motion of two objects, called two-body pursuit problems". Therefore, the appropriate equations of motion to solve two-body pursuit problems would be the kinematic equations, such as the equations relating displacement, velocity, and acceleration."

    "input": "",
    "output": "To solve this problem, we can use the kinematic equation:
$\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}at^2$
where:
$\Delta x$ is the displacement
$a$ is the acceleration
$t$ is the time
Plugging in the values:
$\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}(2 \text{ m/s}^2)(5 \text{ s})^2 = 25 \text{ m}$
Therefore, the car's displacement after 5 seconds is 25 meters."

    "output": "The notation $\Delta v = v - v_0$ represents the change in velocity, where $v$ is the final velocity and $v_0$ is the initial velocity. This simplified notation is useful because it directly gives the change in velocity, without needing to explicitly calculate the difference between the final and initial velocities."

    "output": "To solve this problem, we can use the kinematic equation:
$\Delta v = at$
where:
$\Delta v$ is the change in velocity
$a$ is the acceleration
$t$ is the time
Plugging in the values:
$\Delta v = (3 \text{ m/s}^2)(10 \text{ s}) = 30 \text{ m/s}$
The initial velocity was 20 m/s, so the final velocity is:
$v = v_0 + \Delta v = 20 \text{ m/s} + 30 \text{ m/s} = 50 \text{ m/s}$
Therefore, the car's final velocity is 50 m/s."

- Displacement ($\Delta x$) is the change in position, i.e., the difference between the final and initial positions.

    "input": "",
    "output": "To solve this two-body pursuit problem, we can use the kinematic equations.
Let's define the variables:
- Initial distance between person and car: $x_0 = 50 \text{ m}$
- Person's speed: $v_p = 3 \text{ m/s}$
- Car's speed: $v_c = 10 \text{ m/s}$
The relative speed between the person and the car is $v_r = v_p + v_c = 13 \text{ m/s}$.
The time it takes for the person to catch the car is:
$t = \frac{x_0}{v_r} = \frac{50 \text{ m}}{13 \text{ m/s}} = 3.85 \text{ s}$
Therefore, it will take the person approximately 3.85 seconds to catch the car."

    "output": "In the simplified notation presented in the text:
- Initial values are denoted with a subscript 0, e.g., $x_0$ for initial position and $v_0$ for initial velocity.
- Final values have no subscript, e.g., $x$ for final position and $v$ for final velocity.
The key difference is that initial values are denoted with a subscript 0, while final values have no subscript."
