      "To solve this problem, we can use the range equation for projectile motion: R = (v₀²sin(2θ))/g, where R is the range, v₀ is the initial speed, θ is the launch angle, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.

For the 30° shot, the range is 90 m and the initial speed is 50 m/s. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:
90 = (50²sin(2*30°))/g
Solving for g, we get g ≈ 9.8 m/s².

Now, for the 70° shot with a range of 90 m, we can solve for the initial speed v₀:
90 = (v₀²sin(2*70°))/9.8
Solving for v₀, we get v₀ ≈ 70.7 m/s."

Additionally, as long as the sum of the launch angles is less than 90°, two different launch angles can produce the same range, as shown in Figure 4.16. However, if the sum of the launch angles is greater than 90°, the shot with the larger angle (70° in this case) will require a greater initial speed to achieve the same range as the shot with the smaller angle (30°)."

When the sum of the launch angles is greater than 90°, the shot with the larger angle (70° in this case) needs a higher initial speed to achieve the same range as the shot with the smaller angle (30°).
