To find the direction of a vector, we use the formula: θ = tan^-1(A_y/A_x) for a 2D vector, or θ = tan^-1(A_y/A_x) and φ = tan^-1(A_z/√(A_x^2 + A_y^2)) for a 3D vector, where θ and φ are the angles the vector makes with the positive x-axis and the positive z-axis, respectively."

1. Identify the coordinate system (e.g., Cartesian, polar, or spherical).
2. Determine the angle(s) the vector makes with the coordinate axes.
3. Use trigonometric functions to calculate the scalar components of the vector along each axis.
For example, in a 2D Cartesian system, if a vector A has a magnitude of 5 units and makes an angle of 30° with the positive x-axis, the components would be A_x = 5 cos(30°) and A_y = 5 sin(30°)."
