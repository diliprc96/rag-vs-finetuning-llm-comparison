The drag force (F_D) acting on the shell is proportional to the square of the velocity, so as the velocity changes, the acceleration also changes. This is in contrast to a situation where the acceleration is constant, such as when air resistance is neglected."

This is due to the drag force acting on the shell, which opposes its motion and becomes stronger at higher velocities."
