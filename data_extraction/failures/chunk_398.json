      "When a perfectly flexible connector, such as a rope, transmits a force, that force must be parallel to the length of the connector. By Newton's third law, the connector pulls with equal force but in opposite directions on the objects it connects. The tension anywhere in the connector is equal, so once the tension is determined at one location, it is known at all locations along the connector."

    "output": {

    "output": {
      "When a flexible connector, such as a rope or tendon, transmits a force around a corner, the direction of the force can change, but its magnitude remains the same. This is possible because the connector is relatively friction-free, allowing the force to be redirected without losing its strength."

The tension in the connector is transmitted without diminishment, as long as there is no significant friction, and the direction of the force changes to match the orientation of the connector."
