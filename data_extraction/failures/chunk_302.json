      "Example problem:
A particle is moving in a circular path of radius 5 meters at a constant speed of 10 meters per second. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the acceleration of the particle.

Solution:
Given:
- Radius of the circular path, r = 5 meters
- Constant speed of the particle, v = 10 meters per second

To find the magnitude of the acceleration:
a = v^2 / r
a = (10 m/s)^2 / 5 m
a = 20 m/s^2

To find the direction of the acceleration:
The acceleration vector is directed towards the center of the circular motion, as the vector Δv becomes perpendicular to the velocity vector v in the limit Δt→0."

This is because the magnitudes of the position and velocity vectors are constant, i.e., |r(t)| = |r(t+Δt)| and |v(t)| = |v(t+Δt)|. As a result, the two corresponding sides of the triangles are equal in length, making the triangles isosceles.
The fact that the triangles are isosceles is important in establishing the relationship between the change in the velocity vector Δv and the change in the position vector Δr, which is given by Δv = (v/r)Δr."
