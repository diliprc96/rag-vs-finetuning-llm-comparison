When an object is attached to the hook of the spring scale, the spring is stretched or compressed, and the restoring force exerted by the spring is proportional to the displacement of the spring.

The spring scale can be calibrated to display the magnitude of the force acting on the object, using the spring's restoring force as a standard unit of force. The scale allows the user to directly read the force value, without needing to calculate it from the spring's displacement. This makes the spring scale a convenient and practical tool for measuring various forces in a variety of applications."
