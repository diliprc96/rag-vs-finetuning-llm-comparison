      "To solve this problem, we can use the principles of independent horizontal and vertical motion described in the text.

The ball dropped from rest will have a vertical velocity of -9.8 m/s (due to gravity) when it hits the ground. The time it takes for the ball to fall 50 meters can be calculated using the formula:
y = 1/2 * g * t^2
50 = 1/2 * 9.8 * t^2
t = sqrt(50 / 4.9) = 3.2 seconds

The horizontally thrown ball will travel a horizontal distance of:
x = v_x * t = 20 m/s * 3.2 s = 64 meters

Therefore, the horizontal distance between the two balls when they reach the ground is 64 meters."
