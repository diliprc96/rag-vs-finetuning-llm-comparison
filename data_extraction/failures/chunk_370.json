      "To solve this problem, we can use Newton's second law in component form.

Let's define the system of interest as the sports car.

The net force on the sports car is the force exerted by the truck.
The mass of the sports car is 550 kg.
The magnitude of the truck's acceleration is 10 m/s^2.

Using Newton's second law, F = ma, we can calculate the magnitude of the sports car's acceleration:

F = 2200 kg * 10 m/s^2 = 22,000 N
a = F / m = 22,000 N / 550 kg = 40 m/s^2

Therefore, the magnitude of the sports car's acceleration is 40 m/s^2."

Since the net force on the sports car is the force exerted by the truck, and the net force on the truck is the force exerted by the sports car, we can use Newton's second law to relate the accelerations of the two vehicles.

Specifically, the magnitude of the truck's acceleration (10 m/s^2) is given, and we can use this information along with the masses of the vehicles to calculate the magnitude of the sports car's acceleration.

The relationship between the net force and the acceleration of each vehicle is governed by Newton's second law, F = ma, which allows us to determine the unknown acceleration of the sports car given the known acceleration of the truck."

This is important because the net force acting on the system and the resulting acceleration depend on the chosen system of interest. If the wrong system is chosen, the analysis and conclusions drawn may be incorrect.

The text emphasizes that the choice of the system of interest is crucial when applying Newton's second law, and that this choice is not always obvious, especially in more complex situations.
