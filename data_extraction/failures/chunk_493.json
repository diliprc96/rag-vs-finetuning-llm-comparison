      "The Coriolis force is an apparent force that arises due to the rotation of the Earth. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis force deflects moving objects to the right, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it deflects them to the left. This has significant effects on large-scale weather patterns, such as:

- Hurricanes and tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere rotate counterclockwise, while those in the Southern Hemisphere rotate clockwise.
- Winds in low-pressure systems are deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, causing a counterclockwise circulation, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere, causing a clockwise circulation.
- High-pressure systems are associated with clockwise wind circulation in the Southern Hemisphere and counterclockwise circulation in the Northern Hemisphere, though this is less visible since high pressure is associated with sinking air and clear skies."

    "input": "",
    "output": {
      "Low-pressure weather systems are associated with rising air. As air flows inward toward the low-pressure center, it is forced to rise. As the air rises, it cools, and the water vapor in the air condenses, forming clouds. This is why low-pressure systems are often associated with cloudy, rainy weather. Conversely, high-pressure systems are associated with sinking air, which leads to clear skies and dry weather, as the sinking air warms and its relative humidity decreases."

This is due to the Coriolis force, which deflects the inward-flowing winds to the right as they approach the low-pressure center of the hurricane.

    "output": {
      "The terms "hurricane," "typhoon," and "tropical storm" are regionally specific names for the same type of weather system, which is a cyclone characterized by a low-pressure center, strong winds, and heavy rains.

- Hurricane: A tropical cyclone that forms in the Atlantic Ocean, the northeastern Pacific Ocean, or the central North Pacific Ocean.
- Typhoon: A tropical cyclone that forms in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.
- Tropical storm: A tropical cyclone with wind speeds below hurricane/typhoon levels.

Regardless of the regional name, these weather systems all exhibit the same counterclockwise (Northern Hemisphere) or clockwise (Southern Hemisphere) rotation due to the Coriolis force."
