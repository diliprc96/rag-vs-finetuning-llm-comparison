      "To solve this problem, we can use the equation $x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}$, where:
$x_0 = 0$ (the dragster starts from rest)
$v_0 = 0$ (the dragster starts from rest)
$a = 26.0 \text{ m/s}^2$
$t = 5.56 \text{ s}$

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:
$x = 0 + 0 + \frac{1}{2}(26.0 \text{ m/s}^2)(5.56 \text{ s})^2$
$x = 402 \text{ m}$

Therefore, the dragster travels 402 m in 5.56 s."
