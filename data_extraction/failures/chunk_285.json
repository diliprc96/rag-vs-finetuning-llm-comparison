      "To solve this problem, we can use the kinematic equations for motion in a uniform gravitational field:
y = y_0 + v_0y*t - 0.5*g*t^2
where y_0 is the initial height (assumed to be 0), v_0y is the initial vertical velocity, and g is the acceleration due to gravity.
The initial vertical velocity v_0y = v_0*sin(30°) = 50*sin(30°) = 25 m/s.
Setting the vertical velocity to 0 at the maximum height, we can solve for the time t_max to reach the maximum height:
0 = 25*t - 0.5*9.8*t^2
Solving this quadratic equation, we get t_max = 2.55 s.
Plugging this back into the displacement equation, we get the maximum height y_max = 25*2.55 - 0.5*9.8*2.55^2 = 31.25 m."

The initial horizontal velocity v_0x = v_0*cos(45°) = 60*cos(45°) = 42.43 m/s.
The initial vertical velocity v_0y = v_0*sin(45°) = 60*sin(45°) = 42.43 m/s.
Setting the vertical velocity to 0 at the maximum height, we can solve for the time t_max to reach the maximum height:

Without these assumptions, the motion would be much more complex, as the forces acting on the projectile would depend on factors like the projectile's shape, velocity, and the air density.
