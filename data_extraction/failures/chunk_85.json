    "output": "To solve a vector problem graphically, the vector $\vec{D}$ needs to be drawn to scale. For example, if 1 unit of distance (1 km) is represented by a line segment of length $u = 2$ cm, then the total displacement $d = 6u = 6(2 \text{cm}) = 12 \text{cm}$."

For example, if 1 unit of distance (1 km) is represented by a line segment of length $u = 2$ cm, then the scale of the diagram is 2 cm per 1 km."

    "output": "Given:
- The actual displacement is 6 km.
- The scale of the diagram is 2 cm per 1 km.

To find the length of the displacement vector in the diagram:
Length of the displacement vector = Actual displacement × Scale
Length of the displacement vector = 6 km × (2 cm/1 km) = 12 cm"

The direction of a vector is the orientation of the vector in space, indicated by the direction of the arrow. The magnitude and direction together fully describe the vector."

    "output": "The magnitude of the displacement vector $\vec{D}_{AB}$ from point A to point B is the same as the magnitude of the displacement vector $\vec{D}_{BA}$ from point B to point A, so we can write $|D_{AB}| = |D_{BA}| = 6$ km.
However, the vectors $\vec{D}_{AB}$ and $\vec{D}_{BA}$ are in opposite directions, so they are not the same vector."
