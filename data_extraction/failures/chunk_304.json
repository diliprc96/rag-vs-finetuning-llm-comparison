      "To solve this problem, we can use the formula for centripetal acceleration: a_c = v^2 / r, where a_c is the centripetal acceleration, v is the speed, and r is the radius.

Rearranging the formula, we get:
v = sqrt(a_c * r)
Plugging in the values:
v = sqrt(900.0 cm/s^2 * 0.2 m)
v = 60 m/s
Therefore, the speed of a point on the edge of the flywheel is 60 m/s."

Centrifugal force, on the other hand, is an apparent force that acts on an object in a rotating reference frame, seemingly pushing the object outward from the center of rotation. Centrifugal force is not a real force, but rather a result of the object's inertia and the rotating reference frame."
