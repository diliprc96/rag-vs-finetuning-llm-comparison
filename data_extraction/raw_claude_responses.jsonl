Complexity of equations: The expressions for the position, velocity, and acceleration of an object in three-dimensional motion (described by Equations 4.8, 4.9, and 4.10) are generally more complex than the corresponding equations for two-dimensional motion.\n\n3. Trajectory: The possible trajectories of an object in three-dimensional motion are more diverse and can involve more complex paths, such as curved or helical motions, compared to the typically simpler trajectories in two-dimensional motion.\n\n4.

Velocity: The object's velocity is tangential to the circular path, meaning it is perpendicular to the radial direction. The velocity magnitude is constant, but the direction of the velocity vector is constantly changing.\n\n3. Acceleration: The object's acceleration has two components: a tangential component (due to changes in the velocity magnitude) and a radial component (due to changes in the velocity direction). The radial acceleration is directed towards the center of the circular path and is responsible for the object's centripetal motion.\n\nThe relationships between these quantities in circular motion can be described using the equations derived from the general motion equations (Equations 4.8, 4.9, and 4.10).\"\n    }\n  }\n]"}
