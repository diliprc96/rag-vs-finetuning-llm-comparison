    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nDescribe the scope of physics.\n\nCalculate the order of magnitude of a quantity.\n\nCompare measurable length, mass, and timescales quantitatively.\n\nDescribe the relationships among models, theories, and laws.\n\nPhysics is devoted to the understanding of all natural phenomena. In physics, we try to understand physical phenomena at all scalesâfrom the world of subatomic particles to the entire universe. Despite the breadth of the subject, the various subfields of physics share a common core. The same basic training in physics will prepare you to work in any area of physics and the related areas of science and engineering. In this section, we investigate the scope of physics; the scales of length, mass, and time over which the laws of physics have been shown to be applicable; and the process by which science in general, and physics in particular, operates.\n\nThe Scope of Physics\n\nTake another look at the chapter-opening image. The\n\nWhirlpool Galaxy\n\ncontains billions of individual stars as well as huge clouds of gas and dust. Its companion galaxy is also visible to the right. This pair of galaxies lies a staggering billion trillion miles\n\n$(1.4Ã{10}^{21}\\text{mi})(1.4Ã{10}^{21}\\text{mi})$\n\nfrom our own galaxy (which is called the\n\nMilky Way\n\n). The stars and planets that make up the Whirlpool Galaxy might seem to be the furthest thing from most peopleâs everyday lives, but the Whirlpool is a great starting point to think about the forces that hold the universe together. The forces that cause the Whirlpool Galaxy to act as it does are thought to be the same forces we contend with here on Earth, whether we are planning to send a rocket into space or simply planning to raise the walls for a new home. The gravity that causes the stars of the Whirlpool Galaxy to rotate and revolve is thought to be the same as what causes water to flow over hydroelectric dams here on Earth. When you look up at the stars, realize the forces out there are the same as the ones here on Earth. Through a study of\n\nphysics\n\n, you may gain a greater understanding of the interconnectedness of everything we can see and know in this universe.\n\nHumans have created and manufactured millions of different objects. Successive technological periods (often referred to as the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, and so on) are marked by knowledge of the physical properties of certain materials and the ability to manipulate them. This knowledge all stems from physics, whether it's the way a rock would flake when constructing a spear point, the effect of integrating carbon with iron in South Indian and Sri Lankan furnaces to create the earliest high-quality steel, or the proper way to combine perfectly ground and polished pieces of glass to create optical instruments. Our current technological age, the Information Age, can be traced to critical innovations made by people from all backgrounds working together. Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng, for example, invented the MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor). Although unknown to most people, this tiny device, created in 1959 by an Egyptian-born scientist and a Korean-born scientist working in a lab in New Jersey (U.S.), is the basis for modern electronics. More MOSFETs have been produced than any other object in human history. They are used in computers, smartphones, microwave ovens, automotive controls, medical instruments, and nearly every other electronic device.\n\nNext, think about the most exciting modern technologies that you have heard about in the news, such as trains that levitate above tracks, âinvisibility cloaksâ that bend light around them, and microscopic robots that fight cancer cells in our bodies. All these groundbreaking advances, commonplace or unbelievable, rely on the principles of physics. Aside from playing a significant role in technology, professionals such as engineers, pilots, physicians, physical therapists, electricians, and computer programmers apply physics concepts in their daily work. For example, a pilot must understand how wind forces affect a flight path; a physical therapist must understand how the muscles in the body experience forces as they move and bend. As you will learn in this text, the principles of physics are propelling new, exciting technologies, and these principles are applied in a wide range of careers.\n\nThe underlying order of nature makes science in general, and physics in particular, interesting and enjoyable to study. For example, what do a bag of chips and a car battery have in common? Both contain energy that can be converted to other forms. The law of conservation of energy (which says that energy can change form but is never lost) ties together such topics as food calories, batteries, heat, light, and watch springs. Understanding this law makes it easier to learn about the various forms energy takes and how they relate to one another. Apparently unrelated topics are connected through broadly applicable physical laws, permitting an understanding beyond just the memorization of lists of facts.\n\nScience consists of theories and laws that are the general truths of nature, as well as the body of knowledge they encompass. Scientists are continuously trying to expand this body of knowledge and to perfect the expression of the laws that describe it.\n\nPhysics\n\n, which comes from the Greek\n\nphÃºsis\n\n, meaning ânature,â is concerned with describing the interactions of energy, matter, space, and time to uncover the fundamental mechanisms that underlie every phenomenon. This concern for describing the basic phenomena in nature essentially defines the\n\nscope of physics\n\n.\n\nPhysics aims to understand the world around us at the most basic level. It emphasizes the use of a small number of quantitative laws to do this, which can be useful to other fields pushing the performance boundaries of existing technologies. Consider a smartphone (\n\nFigure 1.2\n\n). Physics describes how electricity interacts with the various circuits inside the device. This knowledge helps engineers select the appropriate materials and circuit layout when building a smartphone. Knowledge of the physics underlying these devices is required to shrink their size or increase their processing speed. Or, think about a GPS. Physics describes the relationship between the speed of an object, the distance over which it travels, and the time it takes to travel that distance. GPS relies on precise calculations that account for variations in the Earth's landscapes, the exact distance between orbiting satellites, and even the effect of a complex occurrence of time dilation. Most of these calculations are founded on algorithms developed by Gladys West, a mathematician and computer scientist who programmed the first computers capable of highly accurate remote sensing and positioning. When you use a GPS device, it utilizes these algorithms to recognize where you are and how your position relates to other objects on Earth.\n\nFigure\n\n1.2\n\nThe Apple iPhone is a common smartphone with a GPS function. Physics describes the way that electricity flows through the circuits of this device. Engineers use their knowledge of physics to construct an iPhone with features that consumers will enjoy. One specific feature of an iPhone is the GPS function. A GPS uses physics equations to determine the drive time between two locations on a map. (credit: Jane Whitney)\n\nKnowledge of physics is useful in everyday situations as well as in nonscientific professions. It can help you understand how microwave ovens work, why metals should not be put into them, and why they might affect pacemakers. Physics allows you to understand the hazards of radiation and to evaluate these hazards rationally and more easily. Physics also explains the reason why a black car radiator helps remove heat in a car engine, and it explains why a white roof helps keep the inside of a house cool. Similarly, the operation of a carâs ignition system as well as the transmission of electrical signals throughout our bodyâs nervous system are much easier to understand when you think about them in terms of basic physics.\n\nPhysics is a key element of many important disciplines and contributes directly to others. Chemistry, for exampleâsince it deals with the interactions of atoms and moleculesâhas close ties to atomic and molecular physics. Most branches of engineering are concerned with designing new technologies, processes, or structures within the constraints set by the laws of physics. In architecture, physics is at the heart of structural stability and is involved in the acoustics, heating, lighting, and cooling of buildings. Parts of geology rely heavily on physics, such as radioactive dating of rocks, earthquake analysis, and heat transfer within Earth. Some disciplines, such as biophysics and geophysics, are hybrids of physics and other disciplines.\n\nPhysics has many applications in the biological sciences. On the microscopic level, it helps describe the properties of cells and their environments. On the macroscopic level, it explains the heat, work, and power associated with the human body and its various organ systems. Physics is involved in medical diagnostics, such as radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonic blood flow measurements. Medical therapy sometimes involves physics directly; for example, cancer radiotherapy uses ionizing radiation. Physics also explains sensory phenomena, such as how musical instruments make sound, how the eye detects color, and how lasers transmit information.\n\nIt is not necessary to study all applications of physics formally. What is most useful is knowing the basic laws of physics and developing skills in the analytical methods for applying them. The study of physics also can improve your problem-solving skills. Furthermore, physics retains the most basic aspects of science, so it is used by all the sciences, and the study of physics makes other sciences easier to understand.\n\nThe Scale of Physics\n\nFrom the discussion so far, it should be clear that to accomplish your goals in any of the various fields within the natural sciences and engineering, a thorough grounding in the laws of physics is necessary. The reason for this is simply that the laws of physics govern everything in the observable universe at all measurable scales of length, mass, and time. Now, that is easy enough to say, but to come to grips with what it really means, we need to get a little bit quantitative. So, before surveying the various scales that physics allows us to explore, letâs first look at the concept of âorder of magnitude,â which we use to come to terms with the vast ranges of length, mass, and time that we consider in this text (\n\nFigure 1.3\n\n).\n\nFigure\n\n1.3\n\n(a) Using a scanning tunneling microscope, scientists can see the individual atoms (diameters around 10\n\nâ10\n\nm) that compose this sheet of gold. (b) Tiny phytoplankton swim among crystals of ice in the Antarctic Sea. They range from a few micrometers (1\n\nÎ¼\n\nm is 10\n\nâ6\n\nm) to as much as 2 mm (1 mm is 10\n\nâ3\n\nm) in length. (c) These two colliding galaxies, known as NGC 4676A (right) and NGC 4676B (left), are nicknamed âThe Miceâ because of the tail of gas emanating from each one. They are located 300 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Coma Berenices. Eventually, these two galaxies will merge into one.

Hartig (STScI), the ACS Science Team, and ESA)\n\nOrder of magnitude\n\nThe\n\norder of magnitude\n\nof a number is the power of 10 that most closely approximates it. Thus, the order of magnitude refers to the scale (or size) of a value. Each power of 10 represents a different order of magnitude. For example,\n\n${10}^{1},{10}^{2},{10}^{3},{10}^{1},{10}^{2},{10}^{3},$\n\nand so forth, are all different orders of magnitude, as are\n\n${10}^{0}=1,{10}^{â1},{10}^{â2},{10}^{0}=1,{10}^{â1},{10}^{â2},$\n\nand\n\n${10}^{â3}.{10}^{â3}.$\n\nTo find the order of magnitude of a number, take the base-10 logarithm of the number and round it to the nearest integer, then the order of magnitude of the number is simply the resulting power of 10. For example, the order of magnitude of 800 is 10\n\n3\n\nbecause\n\n${\\text{log}}_{10}800â2.903,{\\text{log}}_{10}800â2.903,$\n\nwhich rounds to 3. Similarly, the order of magnitude of 450 is 10\n\n3\n\nbecause\n\n${\\text{log}}_{10}450â2.653,{\\text{log}}_{10}450â2.653,$\n\nwhich rounds to 3 as well. Thus, we say the numbers 800 and 450 are of the same order of magnitude: 10\n\n3\n\n. However, the order of magnitude of 250 is 10\n\n2\n\nbecause\n\n${\\text{log}}_{10}250â2.397,{\\text{log}}_{10}250â2.397,$\n\nwhich rounds to 2.\n\nAn equivalent but quicker way to find the order of magnitude of a number is first to write it in scientific notation and then check to see whether the first factor is greater than or less than\n\n$\\sqrt{10}={10}^{0.5}â3.\\sqrt{10}={10}^{0.5}â3.$\n\nThe idea is that\n\n$\\sqrt{10}={10}^{0.5}\\sqrt{10}={10}^{0.5}$\n\nis halfway between\n\n$1={10}^{0}1={10}^{0}$\n\nand\n\n$10={10}^{1}10={10}^{1}$\n\non a log base-10 scale. Thus, if the first factor is less than\n\n$\\sqrt{10},\\sqrt{10},$\n\nthen we round it down to 1 and the order of magnitude is simply whatever power of 10 is required to write the number in scientific notation. On the other hand, if the first factor is greater than\n\n$\\sqrt{10},\\sqrt{10},$\n\nthen we round it up to 10 and the order of magnitude is one power of 10 higher than the power needed to write the number in scientific notation. For example, the number 800 can be written in scientific notation as\n\n$8Ã{10}^{2}.8Ã{10}^{2}.$\n\nBecause 8 is bigger than\n\n$\\sqrt{10}â3,\\sqrt{10}â3,$\n\nwe say the order of magnitude of 800 is\n\n${10}^{2+1}={10}^{3}.{10}^{2+1}={10}^{3}.$\n\nThe number 450 can be written as\n\n$4.5Ã{10}^{2},4.5Ã{10}^{2},$\n\nso its order of magnitude is also 10\n\n3\n\nbecause 4.5 is greater than 3. However, 250 written in scientific notation is\n\n$2.5Ã{10}^{2}2.5Ã{10}^{2}$\n\nand 2.5 is less than 3, so its order of magnitude is\n\n${10}^{2}.{10}^{2}.$\n\nThe order of magnitude of a number is designed to be a ballpark estimate for the scale (or size) of its value. It is simply a way of rounding numbers consistently to the nearest (on a logarithmic scale) power of 10. In other words, if numbers differ by one order of magnitude, the one is larger than the other by about ten. This makes doing rough mental math with very big and very small numbers easier. For example, the diameter of a hydrogen atom is on the order of 10\n\nâ10\n\nm, whereas the diameter of the Sun is on the order of 10\n\n9\n\nm, so it would take roughly\n\n${10}^{9}\\text{/}{10}^{â10}={10}^{19}{10}^{9}\\text{/}{10}^{â10}={10}^{19}$\n\nhydrogen atoms to stretch across the diameter of the Sun. This is much easier to do in your head than using the more precise values of\n\n$1.06Ã{10}^{â10}\\text{m}1.06Ã{10}^{â10}\\text{m}$\n\nfor a hydrogen atom diameter and\n\n$1.39Ã{10}^{9}\\text{m}1.39Ã{10}^{9}\\text{m}$\n\nfor the Sunâs diameter, to find that it would take\n\n$1.31Ã{10}^{19}1.31Ã{10}^{19}$\n\nhydrogen atoms to stretch across the Sunâs diameter. In addition to being easier, the rough estimate is also nearly as informative as the precise calculation.\n\nKnown ranges of length, mass, and time\n\nThe vastness of the universe and the breadth over which physics applies are illustrated by the wide range of examples of known lengths, masses, and times (given as orders of magnitude) in\n\nFigure 1.4\n\n. Examining this table will give you a feeling for the range of possible topics in physics and numerical values. A good way to appreciate the vastness of the ranges of values in\n\nFigure 1.4\n\nis to try to answer some simple comparative questions, such as the following:\n\nHow many hydrogen atoms does it take to stretch across the diameter of the Sun?\n\n(Answer: 10\n\n9\n\nm/10\n\nâ10\n\nm = 10\n\n19\n\nhydrogen atoms)\n\nHow many protons are there in a bacterium?\n\n(Answer: 10\n\nâ15\n\nkg/10\n\nâ27\n\nkg = 10\n\n12\n\nprotons)\n\nHow many floating-point operations can a supercomputer do in 1 day?\n\n(Answer: 10\n\n5\n\ns/10\n\nâ17\n\ns = 10\n\n22\n\nfloating-point operations)\n\nIn studying\n\nFigure 1.4\n\n, take some time to come up with similar questions that interest you and then try answering them. Doing this can breathe some life into almost any table of numbers.\n\nFigure\n\n1.4\n\nThis table shows the orders of magnitude of length, mass, and time.\n\nInteractive\n\nVisit\n\nthis site\n\nto explore interactively the vast range of length scales in our universe. Scroll down and up the scale to view hundreds of organisms and objects, and click on the individual objects to learn more about each one.\n\nBuilding Models\n\nHow did we come to know the laws governing natural phenomena? What we refer to as the laws of nature are concise descriptions of the universe around us. They are human statements of the underlying laws or rules that all natural processes follow. Such laws are intrinsic to the universe; humans did not create them and cannot change them. We can only discover and understand them. Their discovery is a very human endeavor, with all the elements of mystery, imagination, struggle, triumph, and disappointment inherent in any creative effort (\n\nFigure 1.5\n\n). The cornerstone of discovering natural laws is observation; scientists must describe the universe as it is, not as we imagine it to be.\n\nFigure\n\n1.5\n\n(a) Enrico\n\nFermi\n\n(1901â1954) was born in Italy. On accepting the Nobel Prize in Stockholm in 1938 for his work on artificial radioactivity produced by neutrons, he took his family to America rather than return home to the government in power at the time. He became an American citizen and was a leading participant in the Manhattan Project. (b) Marie\n\nCurie\n\n(1867â1934) sacrificed monetary assets to help finance her early research and damaged her physical well-being with radiation exposure. She is the only person to win Nobel prizes in both physics and chemistry. One of her daughters also won a Nobel Prize. (credit a: modification of work by United States Department of Energy)\n\nA\n\nmodel\n\nis a representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to display directly. Although a model is justified by experimental tests, it is only accurate in describing certain aspects of a physical system. An example is the Bohr model of single-electron atoms, in which the electron is pictured as orbiting the nucleus, analogous to the way planets orbit the Sun (\n\nFigure 1.6\n\n). We cannot observe electron orbits directly, but the mental image helps explain some of the observations we can make, such as the emission of light from hot gases (atomic spectra). However, other observations show that the picture in the Bohr model is not really what atoms look like. The model is âwrong,â but is still useful for some purposes. Physicists use models for a variety of purposes. For example, models can help physicists analyze a scenario and perform a calculation or models can be used to represent a situation in the form of a computer simulation. Ultimately, however, the results of these calculations and simulations need to be double-checked by other meansânamely, observation and experimentation.\n\nFigure\n\n1.6\n\nWhat is a model? The Bohr model of a single-electron atom shows the electron orbiting the nucleus in one of several possible circular orbits. Like all models, it captures some, but not all, aspects of the physical system.\n\nThe word\n\ntheory\n\nmeans something different to scientists than what is often meant when the word is used in everyday conversation. In particular, to a scientist a theory is not the same as a âguessâ or an âideaâ or even a âhypothesis.â The phrase âitâs just a theoryâ seems meaningless and silly to scientists because science is founded on the notion of theories. To a scientist, a\n\ntheory\n\nis a testable explanation for patterns in nature supported by scientific evidence and verified multiple times by various groups of researchers. Some theories include models to help visualize phenomena whereas others do not. Newtonâs theory of gravity, for example, does not require a model or mental image, because we can observe the objects directly with our own senses. Although models are meant only to describe certain aspects of a physical system accurately, a theory should describe all aspects of any system that falls within its domain of applicability. In particular, any experimentally testable implication of a theory should be verified. If an experiment ever shows an implication of a theory to be false, then the theory is either thrown out or modified suitably (for example, by limiting its domain of applicability).\n\nA\n\nlaw\n\nuses concise language to describe a generalized pattern in nature supported by scientific evidence and repeated experiments. Often, a law can be expressed in the form of a single mathematical equation. Laws and theories are similar in that they are both scientific statements that result from a tested hypothesis and are supported by scientific evidence. However, the designation\n\nlaw\n\nis usually reserved for a concise and very general statement that describes phenomena in nature, such as the law that energy is conserved during any process, or Newtonâs second law of motion, which relates force (\n\nF\n\n), mass (\n\nm\n\n), and acceleration (\n\na\n\n) by the simple equation\n\n$F=ma.F=ma.$\n\nA theory, in contrast, is a less concise statement of observed behavior. For example, the theory of evolution and the theory of relativity cannot be expressed concisely enough to be considered laws. The biggest difference between a law and a theory is that a theory is much more complex and dynamic. A law describes a single action whereas a theory explains an entire group of related phenomena. Less broadly applicable statements are usually called principles (such as Pascalâs principle, which is applicable only in fluids), but the distinction between laws and principles often is not made carefully.\n\nThe models, theories, and laws we devise sometimes imply the existence of objects or phenomena that are as yet unobserved. These predictions are remarkable triumphs and tributes to the power of science. It is the underlying order in the universe that enables scientists to make such spectacular predictions. However, if experimentation does not verify our predictions, then the theory or law is wrong, no matter how elegant or convenient it is. Laws can never be known with absolute certainty because it is impossible to perform every imaginable experiment to confirm a law for every possible scenario. Physicists operate under the assumption that all scientific laws and theories are valid until a counterexample is observed. If a good-quality, verifiable experiment contradicts a well-established law or theory, then the law or theory must be modified or overthrown completely.\n\nThe study of science in general, and physics in particular, is an adventure much like the exploration of an uncharted ocean. Discoveries are made; models, theories, and laws are formulated; and the beauty of the physical universe is made more sublime for the insights gained."

    "chapter": 1,
    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nDescribe how SI base units are defined.\n\nDescribe how derived units are created from base units.\n\nExpress quantities given in SI units using metric prefixes.\n\nAs we saw previously, the range of objects and phenomena studied in physics is immense. From the incredibly short lifetime of a nucleus to the age of Earth, from the tiny sizes of subnuclear particles to the vast distance to the edges of the known universe, from the force exerted by a jumping flea to the force between Earth and the Sun, there are enough factors of 10 to challenge the imagination of even the most experienced scientist. Giving numerical values for physical quantities and equations for physical principles allows us to understand nature much more deeply than qualitative descriptions alone. To comprehend these vast ranges, we must also have accepted units in which to express them. We shall find that even in the potentially mundane discussion of meters, kilograms, and seconds, a profound simplicity of nature appears: all physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of only seven base physical units.\n\nWe define a\n\nphysical quantity\n\neither by specifying how it is measured or by stating how it is calculated from other measurements. For example, we might define distance and time by specifying methods for measuring them, such as using a meter stick and a stopwatch. Then, we could define\n\naverage speed\n\nby stating that it is calculated as the total distance traveled divided by time of travel.\n\nMeasurements of physical quantities are expressed in terms of\n\nunits\n\n, which are standardized values. For example, the length of a race, which is a physical quantity, can be expressed in units of meters (for sprinters) or kilometers (for distance runners). Without standardized units, it would be extremely difficult for scientists to express and compare measured values in a meaningful way (\n\nFigure 1.7\n\n).\n\nFigure\n\n1.7\n\nDistances given in unknown units are maddeningly useless.\n\nTwo major systems of units are used in the world:\n\nSI units\n\n(for the French\n\nSystÃ¨me International dâUnitÃ©s\n\n), also known as the\n\nmetric system\n\n, and\n\nEnglish units\n\n(also known as the\n\ncustomary\n\nor\n\nimperial system\n\n). English units were historically used in nations once ruled by the British Empire and are still widely used in the United States. English units may also be referred to as the\n\nfootâpoundâsecond\n\n(fps) system, as opposed to the\n\ncentimeterâgramâsecond\n\n(cgs) system. You may also encounter the term\n\nSAE units\n\n, named after the Society of Automotive Engineers. Products such as fasteners and automotive tools (for example, wrenches) that are measured in inches rather than metric units are referred to as\n\nSAE fasteners\n\nor\n\nSAE wrenches\n\n.\n\nVirtually every other country in the world (except the United States) now uses SI units as the standard. The metric system is also the standard system agreed on by scientists and mathematicians.\n\nSI Units: Base and Derived Units\n\nIn any system of units, the units for some physical quantities must be defined through a measurement process. These are called the\n\nbase quantities\n\nfor that system and their units are the systemâs\n\nbase unit\n\ns\n\n. All other physical quantities can then be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base quantities. Each of these physical quantities is then known as a\n\nderived quantity\n\nand each unit is called a\n\nderived unit\n\n. The choice of base quantities is somewhat arbitrary, as long as they are independent of each other and all other quantities can be derived from them. Typically, the goal is to choose physical quantities that can be measured accurately to a high precision as the base quantities. The reason for this is simple. Since the\n\nderived units\n\ncan be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base units, they can only be as accurate and precise as the base units from which they are derived.\n\nBased on such considerations, the International Standards Organization recommends using seven base quantities, which form the International System of Quantities (ISQ). These are the base quantities used to define the SI base units.\n\nTable 1.1\n\nlists these seven ISQ base quantities and the corresponding SI base units.\n\nISQ Base Quantity\n\nSI Base Unit\n\nLength\n\nmeter (m)\n\nMass\n\nkilogram (kg)\n\nTime\n\nsecond (s)\n\nElectrical current\n\nampere (A)\n\nThermodynamic temperature\n\nkelvin (K)\n\nAmount of substance\n\nmole (mol)\n\nLuminous intensity\n\ncandela (cd)\n\nTable\n\n1.1\n\nISQ Base Quantities and Their SI Units\n\nYou are probably already familiar with some derived quantities that can be formed from the base quantities in\n\nTable 1.1\n\n. For example, the geometric concept of area is always calculated as the product of two lengths. Thus, area is a derived quantity that can be expressed in terms of SI base units using square meters\n\n$(\\text{m}Ã\\text{m}={\\text{m}}^{2}).(\\text{m}Ã\\text{m}={\\text{m}}^{2}).$\n\nSimilarly, volume is a derived quantity that can be expressed in cubic meters\n\n$({\\text{m}}^{3}).({\\text{m}}^{3}).$\n\nSpeed is length per time; so in terms of SI base units, we could measure it in meters per second (m/s). Volume mass density (or just density) is mass per volume, which is expressed in terms of SI base units such as kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m\n\n3\n\n). Angles can also be thought of as derived quantities because they can be defined as the ratio of the arc length subtended by two radii of a circle to the radius of the circle. This is how the radian is defined. Depending on your background and interests, you may be able to come up with other derived quantities, such as the mass flow rate (kg/s) or volume flow rate (m\n\n3\n\n/s) of a fluid, electric charge\n\n$(\\text{A}Â·\\text{s}),(\\text{A}Â·\\text{s}),$\n\nmass flux density\n\n$\\text{[kg/}({\\text{m}}^{2}Â·\\text{s)],}\\text{[kg/}({\\text{m}}^{2}Â·\\text{s)],}$\n\nand so on. We will see many more examples throughout this text. For now, the point is that every physical quantity can be derived from the seven base quantities in\n\nTable 1.1\n\n, and the units of every physical quantity can be derived from the seven SI base units.\n\nFor the most part, we use SI units in this text. Non-SI units are used in a few applications in which they are in very common use, such as the measurement of temperature in degrees Celsius\n\n$(\\text{Â°}\\text{C}),(\\text{Â°}\\text{C}),$\n\nthe measurement of fluid volume in liters (L), and the measurement of energies of elementary particles in electron-volts (eV). Whenever non-SI units are discussed, they are tied to SI units through conversions. For example, 1 L is\n\n${10}^{â3}{\\text{m}}^{3}.{10}^{â3}{\\text{m}}^{3}.$\n\nInteractive\n\nCheck out a comprehensive source of information on\n\nSI units\n\nat the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty.\n\nUnits of Time, Length, and Mass: The Second, Meter, and Kilogram\n\nThe initial chapters in this textbook are concerned with mechanics, fluids, and waves. In these subjects all pertinent physical quantities can be expressed in terms of the base units of length, mass, and time. Therefore, we now turn to a discussion of these three base units, leaving discussion of the others until they are needed later.\n\nThe second\n\nThe SI unit for time, the\n\nsecond\n\n(abbreviated s), has a long history. For many years it was defined as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day. More recently, a new standard was adopted to gain greater accuracy and to define the second in terms of a nonvarying or constant physical phenomenon (because the solar day is getting longer as a result of the very gradual slowing of Earthâs rotation). Cesium atoms can be made to vibrate in a very steady way, and these vibrations can be readily observed and counted. In 1967, the second was redefined as the time required for 9,192,631,770 of these vibrations to occur (\n\nFigure 1.8\n\n). Note that this may seem like more precision than you would ever need, but it isnâtâGPSs rely on the precision of atomic clocks to be able to give you turn-by-turn directions on the surface of Earth, far from the satellites broadcasting their location.\n\nFigure\n\n1.8\n\nAn atomic clock such as this one uses the vibrations of cesium atoms to keep time to a precision of better than a microsecond per year. The fundamental unit of time, the second, is based on such clocks. This image looks down from the top of an atomic fountain nearly 30 feet tall. (credit: Steve Jurvetson)\n\nThe meter\n\nThe SI unit for length is the\n\nmeter\n\n(abbreviated m); its definition has also changed over time to become more precise. The meter was first defined in 1791 as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. This measurement was improved in 1889 by redefining the meter to be the distance between two engraved lines on a platinumâiridium bar now kept near Paris. By 1960, it had become possible to define the meter even more accurately in terms of the wavelength of light, so it was again redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of orange light emitted by krypton atoms. In 1983, the meter was given its current definition (in part for greater accuracy) as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second (\n\nFigure 1.9\n\n). This change came after knowing the speed of light to be exactly 299,792,458 m/s.\n\nFigure\n\n1.9\n\nThe meter is defined to be the distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 of a second in a vacuum. Distance traveled is speed multiplied by time.\n\nThe kilogram\n\nThe SI unit for mass is the\n\nkilogram\n\n(abbreviated kg); From 1795â2018 it was defined to be the mass of a platinumâiridium cylinder kept with the old meter standard at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. However, this cylinder has lost roughly 50 micrograms since it was created. Because this is the standard, this has shifted how we defined a kilogram. Therefore, a new definition was adopted in May 2019 based on the Planck constant and other constants which will never change in value. We will study Planckâs constant in quantum mechanics, which is an area of physics that describes how the smallest pieces of the universe work. The kilogram is measured on a Kibble balance (see\n\nFigure 1.10\n\n). When a weight is placed on a Kibble balance, an electrical current is produced that is proportional to Planckâs constant. Since Planckâs constant is defined, the exact current measurements in the balance define the kilogram.\n\nFigure\n\n1.10\n\nRedefining the SI unit of mass. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technologyâs Kibble balance is a machine that balances the weight of a test mass with the resulting electrical current needed for a force to balance it.\n\nMetric Prefixes\n\nSI units are part of the\n\nmetric system\n\n, which is convenient for scientific and engineering calculations because the units are categorized by factors of 10.\n\nTable 1.2\n\nlists the metric prefixes and symbols used to denote various factors of 10 in SI units. For example, a centimeter is one-hundredth of a meter (in symbols, 1 cm = 10\n\nâ2\n\nm) and a kilometer is a thousand meters (1 km = 10\n\n3\n\nm). Similarly, a megagram is a million grams (1 Mg = 10\n\n6\n\ng), a nanosecond is a billionth of a second (1 ns = 10\n\nâ9\n\ns), and a terameter is a trillion meters (1 Tm = 10\n\n12\n\nm).\n\nPrefix\n\nSymbol\n\nMeaning\n\nPrefix\n\nSymbol\n\nMeaning\n\nyotta-\n\nY\n\n10\n\n24\n\nyocto-\n\ny\n\n10\n\nâ24\n\nzetta-\n\nZ\n\n10\n\n21\n\nzepto-\n\nz\n\n10\n\nâ21\n\nexa-\n\nE\n\n10\n\n18\n\natto-\n\na\n\n10\n\nâ18\n\npeta-\n\nP\n\n10\n\n15\n\nfemto-\n\nf\n\n10\n\nâ15\n\ntera-\n\nT\n\n10\n\n12\n\npico-\n\np\n\n10\n\nâ12\n\ngiga-\n\nG\n\n10\n\n9\n\nnano-\n\nn\n\n10\n\nâ9\n\nmega-\n\nM\n\n10\n\n6\n\nmicro-\n\n$Î¼Î¼$\n\n10\n\nâ6\n\nkilo-\n\nk\n\n10\n\n3\n\nmilli-\n\nm\n\n10\n\nâ3\n\nhecto-\n\nh\n\n10\n\n2\n\ncenti-\n\nc\n\n10\n\nâ2\n\ndeka-\n\nda\n\n10\n\n1\n\ndeci-\n\nd\n\n10\n\nâ1\n\nTable\n\n1.2\n\nMetric Prefixes for Powers of 10 and Their Symbols\n\nThe only rule when using metric prefixes is that you cannot âdouble them up.â For example, if you have measurements in petameters (1 Pm = 10\n\n15\n\nm), it is not proper to talk about megagigameters, although\n\n${10}^{6}Ã{10}^{9}={10}^{15}.{10}^{6}Ã{10}^{9}={10}^{15}.$\n\nIn practice, the only time this becomes a bit confusing is when discussing masses. As we have seen, the base SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg), but metric prefixes need to be applied to the gram (g), because we are not allowed to âdouble-upâ prefixes. Thus, a thousand kilograms (10\n\n3\n\nkg) is written as a megagram (1 Mg) since\n\n${10}^{3}\\text{kg}={10}^{3}Ã{10}^{3}\\text{g}={10}^{6}\\text{g}=1\\text{Mg}\\text{.}{10}^{3}\\text{kg}={10}^{3}Ã{10}^{3}\\text{g}={10}^{6}\\text{g}=1\\text{Mg}\\text{.}$\n\nIncidentally, 10\n\n3\n\nkg is also called a\n\nmetric ton\n\n, abbreviated t. This is one of the units outside the SI system considered acceptable for use with SI units.\n\nAs we see in the next section, metric systems have the advantage that conversions of units involve only powers of 10. There are 100 cm in 1 m, 1000 m in 1 km, and so on. In nonmetric systems, such as the English system of units, the relationships are not as simpleâthere are 12 in. in 1 ft, 5280 ft in 1 mi, and so on.\n\nAnother advantage of metric systems is that the same unit can be used over extremely large ranges of values simply by scaling it with an appropriate metric prefix. The prefix is chosen by the order of magnitude of physical quantities commonly found in the task at hand. For example, distances in meters are suitable in construction, whereas distances in kilometers are appropriate for air travel, and nanometers are convenient in optical design. With the metric system there is no need to invent new units for particular applications. Instead, we rescale the units with which we are already familiar.\n\nExample\n\n1.1\n\nUsing Metric Prefixes\n\nRestate the mass\n\n$1.93Ã{10}^{13}\\text{kg}1.93Ã{10}^{13}\\text{kg}$\n\nusing a metric prefix such that the resulting numerical value is bigger than one but less than 1000.\n\nStrategy\n\nSince we are not allowed to âdouble-upâ prefixes, we first need to restate the mass in grams by replacing the prefix symbol k with a factor of 10\n\n3\n\n(see\n\nTable 1.2\n\n). Then, we should see which two prefixes in\n\nTable 1.2\n\nare closest to the resulting power of 10 when the number is written in scientific notation. We use whichever of these two prefixes gives us a number between one and 1000.\n\nSolution\n\nReplacing the k in kilogram with a factor of 10\n\n3\n\n, we find that\n\n$1.93Ã{10}^{13}\\text{kg}=1.93Ã{10}^{13}Ã{10}^{3}\\text{g}=1.93Ã{10}^{16}\\text{g}\\text{.}1.93Ã{10}^{13}\\text{kg}=1.93Ã{10}^{13}Ã{10}^{3}\\text{g}=1.93Ã{10}^{16}\\text{g}\\text{.}$\n\nFrom\n\nTable 1.2\n\n, we see that 10\n\n16\n\nis between âpeta-â (10\n\n15\n\n) and âexa-â (10\n\n18\n\n). If we use the âpeta-â prefix, then we find that\n\n$1.93Ã{10}^{16}\\text{g}=1.93Ã{10}^{1}\\text{Pg},1.93Ã{10}^{16}\\text{g}=1.93Ã{10}^{1}\\text{Pg},$\n\nsince\n\n$16=1+15.16=1+15.$\n\nAlternatively, if we use the âexa-â prefix we find that\n\n$1.93Ã{10}^{16}\\text{g}=1.93Ã{10}^{â2}\\text{Eg},1.93Ã{10}^{16}\\text{g}=1.93Ã{10}^{â2}\\text{Eg},$\n\nsince\n\n$16=â2+18.16=â2+18.$\n\nBecause the problem asks for the numerical value between one and 1000, we use the âpeta-â prefix and the answer is 19.3 Pg.\n\nSignificance\n\nIt is easy to make silly arithmetic errors when switching from one prefix to another, so it is always a good idea to check that our final answer matches the number we started with. An easy way to do this is to put both numbers in scientific notation and count powers of 10, including the ones hidden in prefixes. If we did not make a mistake, the powers of 10 should match up. In this problem, we started with\n\n$1.93Ã{10}^{13}\\text{kg,}1.93Ã{10}^{13}\\text{kg,}$\n\nso we have 13 + 3 = 16 powers of 10. Our final answer in scientific notation is\n\n$1.93Ã{10}^{1}1.93Ã{10}^{1}$\n\nPg, so we have 1 + 15 = 16 powers of 10. So, everything checks out.\n\nIf this mass arose from a calculation, we would also want to check to determine whether a mass this large makes any sense in the context of the problem. For this,\n\nFigure 1.4\n\nmight be helpful.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n1.1\n\nRestate\n\n$4.79Ã{10}^{5}\\text{kg}4.79Ã{10}^{5}\\text{kg}$\n\nusing a metric prefix such that the resulting number is bigger than one but less than 1000."

    "chapter": 1,
    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nUse conversion factors to express the value of a given quantity in different units.\n\nIt is often necessary to convert from one unit to another. For example, if you are reading a European cookbook, some quantities may be expressed in units of liters and you need to convert them to cups. Or perhaps you are reading walking directions from one location to another and you are interested in how many miles you will be walking. In this case, you may need to convert units of feet or meters to miles.\n\nLetâs consider a simple example of how to convert units. Suppose we want to convert 80 m to kilometers. The first thing to do is to list the units you have and the units to which you want to convert. In this case, we have units in\n\nmeters\n\nand we want to convert to\n\nkilometers\n\n. Next, we need to determine a conversion factor relating meters to kilometers. A\n\nconversion factor\n\nis a ratio that expresses how many of one unit are equal to another unit. For example, there are 12 in. in 1 ft, 1609 m in 1 mi, 100 cm in 1 m, 60 s in 1 min, and so on. Refer to\n\nAppendix B\n\nfor a more complete list of conversion factors. In this case, we know that there are 1000 m in 1 km. Now we can set up our unit conversion. We write the units we have and then multiply them by the conversion factor so the units cancel out, as shown:\n\n$80\\text{m}Ã\\frac{1\\text{km}}{1000\\text{m}}=0.080\\text{km}.80\\text{m}Ã\\frac{1\\text{km}}{1000\\text{m}}=0.080\\text{km}.$\n\nNote that the unwanted meter unit cancels, leaving only the desired kilometer unit. You can use this method to convert between any type of unit. Now, the conversion of 80 m to kilometers is simply the use of a metric prefix, as we saw in the preceding section, so we can get the same answer just as easily by noting that\n\n$80\\text{m}=8.0Ã{10}^{1}\\text{m}=8.0Ã{10}^{â2}\\text{km}=0.080\\text{km,}80\\text{m}=8.0Ã{10}^{1}\\text{m}=8.0Ã{10}^{â2}\\text{km}=0.080\\text{km,}$\n\nsince âkilo-â means 10\n\n3\n\n(see\n\nTable 1.2\n\n) and\n\n$1=â2+3.1=â2+3.$\n\nHowever, using conversion factors is handy when converting between units that are not metric or when converting between derived units, as the following examples illustrate.\n\nExample\n\n1.2\n\nConverting Nonmetric Units to Metric\n\nThe distance from the university to home is 10 mi and it usually takes 20 min to drive this distance. Calculate the average speed in meters per second (m/s). (\n\nNote:\n\nAverage speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel.)\n\nStrategy\n\nFirst we calculate the average speed using the given units, then we can get the average speed into the desired units by picking the correct conversion factors and multiplying by them. The correct conversion factors are those that cancel the unwanted units and leave the desired units in their place. In this case, we want to convert miles to meters, so we need to know the fact that there are 1609 m in 1 mi. We also want to convert minutes to seconds, so we use the conversion of 60 s in 1 min.\n\nSolution\n\nCalculate average speed. Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel. (Take this definition as a given for now. Average speed and other motion concepts are covered in later chapters.) In equation form,\n\n$\\text{Average speed}=\\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}.\\text{Average speed}=\\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}.$\n\nSubstitute the given values for distance and time:\n\n$\\text{Average speed}=\\frac{10\\text{mi}}{20\\text{min}}=0.50\\frac{\\text{mi}}{\\text{min}}.\\text{Average speed}=\\frac{10\\text{mi}}{20\\text{min}}=0.50\\frac{\\text{mi}}{\\text{min}}.$\n\nConvert miles per minute to meters per second by multiplying by the conversion factor that cancels miles and leave meters, and also by the conversion factor that cancels minutes and leave seconds:\n\n$0.50\\frac{\\text{mile}}{\\text{min}}Ã\\frac{1609\\text{m}}{1\\text{mile}}Ã\\frac{1\\text{min}}{60\\text{s}}=\\frac{(0.50)(1609)}{60}\\text{m/s}=13\\text{m/s}.0.50\\frac{\\text{mile}}{\\text{min}}Ã\\frac{1609\\text{m}}{1\\text{mile}}Ã\\frac{1\\text{min}}{60\\text{s}}=\\frac{(0.50)(1609)}{60}\\text{m/s}=13\\text{m/s}.$\n\nSignificance\n\nCheck the answer in the following ways:\n\nBe sure the units in the unit conversion cancel correctly. If the unit conversion factor was written upside down, the units do not cancel correctly in the equation. We see the âmilesâ in the numerator in 0.50 mi/min cancels the âmileâ in the denominator in the first conversion factor. Also, the âminâ in the denominator in 0.50 mi/min cancels the âminâ in the numerator in the second conversion factor.\n\nCheck that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem asked us to solve for average speed in units of meters per second and, after the cancellations, the only units left are a meter (m) in the numerator and a second (s) in the denominator, so we have indeed obtained these units.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n1.2\n\nLight travels about 9 Pm in a year. Given that a year is about\n\n$3Ã{10}^{7}\\text{s},3Ã{10}^{7}\\text{s},$\n\nwhat is the speed of light in meters per second?\n\nExample\n\n1.3\n\nConverting between Metric Units\n\nThe density of iron is\n\n$7.86{\\text{g/cm}}^{3}7.86{\\text{g/cm}}^{3}$\n\nunder standard conditions. Convert this to kg/m\n\n3\n\n.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe need to convert grams to kilograms and cubic centimeters to cubic meters. The conversion factors we need are\n\n$1\\text{kg}={10}^{3}\\text{g}1\\text{kg}={10}^{3}\\text{g}$\n\nand\n\n$1\\text{cm}={10}^{â2}\\text{m}\\text{.}1\\text{cm}={10}^{â2}\\text{m}\\text{.}$\n\nHowever, we are dealing with cubic centimeters\n\n${\\text{(cm}}^{3}=\\text{cm}Ã\\text{cm}Ã\\text{cm),}{\\text{(cm}}^{3}=\\text{cm}Ã\\text{cm}Ã\\text{cm),}$\n\nso we have to use the second conversion factor three times (that is, we need to cube it). The idea is still to multiply by the conversion factors in such a way that they cancel the units we want to get rid of and introduce the units we want to keep.\n\nSolution\n\n$7.86\\frac{\\text{g}}{{\\text{cm}}^{3}}Ã\\frac{\\text{kg}}{{10}^{3}\\text{g}}Ã{(\\frac{\\text{cm}}{{10}^{â2}\\text{m}})}^{3}=\\frac{7.86}{({10}^{3})({10}^{â6})}{\\text{kg/m}}^{3}=7.86Ã{10}^{3}{\\text{kg/m}}^{3}7.86\\frac{\\text{g}}{{\\text{cm}}^{3}}Ã\\frac{\\text{kg}}{{10}^{3}\\text{g}}Ã{(\\frac{\\text{cm}}{{10}^{â2}\\text{m}})}^{3}=\\frac{7.86}{({10}^{3})({10}^{â6})}{\\text{kg/m}}^{3}=7.86Ã{10}^{3}{\\text{kg/m}}^{3}$\n\nSignificance\n\nRemember, itâs always important to check the answer.\n\nBe sure to cancel the units in the unit conversion correctly. We see that the gram (âgâ) in the numerator in 7.86 g/cm\n\n3\n\ncancels the âgâ in the denominator in the first conversion factor. Also, the three factors of âcmâ in the denominator in 7.86 g/cm\n\n3\n\ncancel with the three factors of âcmâ in the numerator that we get by cubing the second conversion factor.\n\nCheck that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem asked for us to convert to kilograms per cubic meter. After the cancellations just described, we see the only units we have left are âkgâ in the numerator and three factors of âmâ in the denominator (that is, one factor of âmâ cubed, or âm\n\n3\n\nâ). Therefore, the units on the final answer are correct.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n1.3\n\nWe know from\n\nFigure 1.4\n\nthat the diameter of Earth is on the order of 10\n\n7\n\nm, so the order of magnitude of its surface area is 10\n\n14\n\nm\n\n2\n\n. What is that in square kilometers (that is, km\n\n2\n\n)? (Try doing this both by converting 10\n\n7\n\nm to km and then squaring it and then by converting 10\n\n14\n\nm\n\n2\n\ndirectly to square kilometers. You should get the same answer both ways.)\n\nUnit conversions may not seem very interesting, but not doing them can be costly. One famous example of this situation was seen with the\n\nMars Climate Orbiter\n\n. This probe was launched by NASA on December 11, 1998. On September 23, 1999, while attempting to guide the probe into its planned orbit around Mars, NASA lost contact with it. Subsequent investigations showed a piece of software called SM_FORCES (or âsmall forcesâ) was recording thruster performance data in the English units of pound-force-seconds (lbf-s). However, other pieces of software that used these values for course corrections expected them to be recorded in the SI units of newton-seconds (N-s), as dictated in the software interface protocols. This error caused the probe to follow a very different trajectory from what NASA thought it was following, which most likely caused the probe either to burn up in the Martian atmosphere or to shoot out into space. This failure to pay attention to unit conversions cost hundreds of millions of dollars, not to mention all the time invested by the scientists and engineers who worked on the project.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n1.4\n\nGiven that 1 lbf (pound-force) is 4.45 N, were the numbers being output by SM_FORCES too big or too small?"

For example, a measurement of length is said to have dimension L or L\n\n1\n\n, a measurement of mass has dimension M or M\n\n1\n\n, and a measurement of time has dimension T or T\n\n1\n\n. Like units, dimensions obey the rules of algebra. Thus, area is the product of two lengths and so has dimension L\n\n2\n\n, or length squared. Similarly, volume is the product of three lengths and has dimension L\n\n3\n\n, or length cubed. Speed has dimension length over time, L/T or LT\n\nâ1\n\n. Volumetric mass density has dimension M/L\n\n3\n\nor ML\n\nâ3\n\n, or mass over length cubed.

If we use the symbol\n\n$mm$\n\nfor the mass of the cylinder and\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\nfor the density of the material from which the cylinder is made, then\n\n$[m]=\\text{M}[m]=\\text{M}$\n\nand\n\n$[Ï]={\\text{ML}}^{â3}.[Ï]={\\text{ML}}^{â3}.$\n\nThe importance of the concept of dimension arises from the fact that any mathematical equation relating physical quantities must be\n\ndimensionally consistent\n\n, which means the equation must obey the following rules:\n\nEvery term in an expression must have the same dimensions; it does not make sense to add or subtract quantities of differing dimension (think of the old saying: âYou canât add apples and orangesâ). In particular, the expressions on each side of the equality in an equation must have the same dimensions.\n\nThe arguments of any of the standard mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions (such as sine and cosine), logarithms, or exponential functions that appear in the equation must be dimensionless. These functions require pure numbers as inputs and give pure numbers as outputs.\n\nIf either of these rules is violated, an equation is not dimensionally consistent and cannot possibly be a correct statement of physical law. This simple fact can be used to check for typos or algebra mistakes, to help remember the various laws of physics, and even to suggest the form that new laws of physics might take. This last use of dimensions is beyond the scope of this text, but is something you may learn later in your academic career.\n\nExample\n\n1.4\n\nUsing Dimensions to Remember an Equation\n\nSuppose we need the formula for the area of a circle for some computation. Like many people who learned geometry too long ago to recall with any certainty, two expressions may pop into our mind when we think of circles:\n\n$Ï{r}^{2}Ï{r}^{2}$\n\nand\n\n$2Ïr.2Ïr.$\n\nOne expression is the circumference of a circle of radius\n\nr\n\nand the other is its area. But which is which?\n\nStrategy\n\nOne natural strategy is to look it up, but this could take time to find information from a reputable source. Besides, even if we think the source is reputable, we shouldnât trust everything we read. It is nice to have a way to double-check just by thinking about it. Also, we might be in a situation in which we cannot look things up (such as during a test). Thus, the strategy is to find the dimensions of both expressions by making use of the fact that dimensions follow the rules of algebra. If either expression does not have the same dimensions as area, then it cannot possibly be the correct equation for the area of a circle.\n\nSolution\n\nWe know the dimension of area is L\n\n2\n\n. Now, the dimension of the expression\n\n$Ï{r}^{2}Ï{r}^{2}$\n\nis\n\n$[Ï{r}^{2}]=[Ï]Â·{[r]}^{2}=1Â·{\\text{L}}^{2}={\\text{L}}^{2},[Ï{r}^{2}]=[Ï]Â·{[r]}^{2}=1Â·{\\text{L}}^{2}={\\text{L}}^{2},$\n\nsince the constant\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\nis a pure number and the radius\n\n$rr$\n\nis a length. Therefore,\n\n$Ï{r}^{2}Ï{r}^{2}$\n\nhas the dimension of area. Similarly, the dimension of the expression\n\n$2Ïr2Ïr$\n\nis\n\n$[2Ïr]=[2]Â·[Ï]Â·[r]=1Â·1Â·\\text{L}=\\text{L,}[2Ïr]=[2]Â·[Ï]Â·[r]=1Â·1Â·\\text{L}=\\text{L,}$\n\nsince the constants\n\n$22$\n\nand\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\nare both dimensionless and the radius\n\n$rr$\n\nis a length. We see that\n\n$2Ïr2Ïr$\n\nhas the dimension of length, which means it cannot possibly be an area.\n\nWe rule out\n\n$2Ïr2Ïr$\n\nbecause it is not dimensionally consistent with being an area. We see that\n\n$Ï{r}^{2}Ï{r}^{2}$\n\nis dimensionally consistent with being an area, so if we have to choose between these two expressions,\n\n$Ï{r}^{2}Ï{r}^{2}$\n\nis the one to choose.\n\nSignificance\n\nThis may seem like kind of a silly example, but the ideas are very general. As long as we know the dimensions of the individual physical quantities that appear in an equation, we can check to see whether the equation is dimensionally consistent. On the other hand, knowing that true equations are dimensionally consistent, we can match expressions from our imperfect memories to the quantities for which they might be expressions. Doing this will not help us remember dimensionless factors that appear in the equations (for example, if you had accidentally conflated the two expressions from the example into\n\n$2Ï{r}^{2},2Ï{r}^{2},$\n\nthen dimensional analysis is no help), but it does help us remember the correct basic form of equations.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n1.5\n\nSuppose we want the formula for the volume of a sphere. The two expressions commonly mentioned in elementary discussions of spheres are\n\n$4Ï{r}^{2}4Ï{r}^{2}$\n\nand\n\n$4Ï{r}^{3}\\text{/}3.4Ï{r}^{3}\\text{/}3.$\n\nOne is the volume of a sphere of radius\n\nr\n\nand the other is its surface area. Which one is the volume?\n\nExample\n\n1.5\n\nChecking Equations for Dimensional Consistency\n\nConsider the physical quantities\n\n$s,s,$\n\n$v,v,$\n\n$a,a,$\n\nand\n\n$tt$\n\nwith dimensions\n\n$[s]=\\text{L},[s]=\\text{L},$\n\n$[v]={\\text{LT}}^{â1},[v]={\\text{LT}}^{â1},$\n\n$[a]={\\text{LT}}^{â2},[a]={\\text{LT}}^{â2},$\n\nand\n\n$[t]=\\text{T}.[t]=\\text{T}.$\n\nDetermine whether each of the following equations is dimensionally consistent: (a)\n\n$s=vt+0.5a{t}^{2};s=vt+0.5a{t}^{2};$\n\n(b)\n\n$s=v{t}^{2}+0.5at;s=v{t}^{2}+0.5at;$\n\nand (c)\n\n$v=\\text{sin}(a{t}^{2}\\text{/}s).v=\\text{sin}(a{t}^{2}\\text{/}s).$\n\nStrategy\n\nBy the definition of dimensional consistency, we need to check that each term in a given equation has the same dimensions as the other terms in that equation and that the arguments of any standard mathematical functions are dimensionless.\n\nSolution\n\nThere are no trigonometric, logarithmic, or exponential functions to worry about in this equation, so we need only look at the dimensions of each term appearing in the equation. There are three terms, one in the left expression and two in the expression on the right, so we look at each in turn:\n\n$[s]=\\text{L}[vt]=[v]Â·[t]={\\text{LT}}^{â1}Â·\\text{T}={\\text{LT}}^{0}=\\text{L}[0.5a{t}^{2}]=[a]Â·{[t]}^{2}={\\text{LT}}^{â2}Â·{\\text{T}}^{2}={\\text{LT}}^{0}=\\text{L}\\text{.}[s]=\\text{L}[vt]=[v]Â·[t]={\\text{LT}}^{â1}Â·\\text{T}={\\text{LT}}^{0}=\\text{L}[0.5a{t}^{2}]=[a]Â·{[t]}^{2}={\\text{LT}}^{â2}Â·{\\text{T}}^{2}={\\text{LT}}^{0}=\\text{L}\\text{.}$\n\nAll three terms have the same dimension, so this equation is dimensionally consistent.\n\nAgain, there are no trigonometric, exponential, or logarithmic functions, so we only need to look at the dimensions of each of the three terms appearing in the equation:\n\n$[s]=\\text{L}[v{t}^{2}]=[v]Â·{[t]}^{2}={\\text{LT}}^{â1}Â·{\\text{T}}^{2}=\\text{LT}[at]=[a]Â·[t]={\\text{LT}}^{â2}Â·\\text{T}={\\text{LT}}^{â1}.[s]=\\text{L}[v{t}^{2}]=[v]Â·{[t]}^{2}={\\text{LT}}^{â1}Â·{\\text{T}}^{2}=\\text{LT}[at]=[a]Â·[t]={\\text{LT}}^{â2}Â·\\text{T}={\\text{LT}}^{â1}.$\n\nNone of the three terms has the same dimension as any other, so this is about as far from being dimensionally consistent as you can get. The technical term for an equation like this is\n\nnonsense\n\n.\n\nThis equation has a trigonometric function in it, so first we should check that the argument of the sine function is dimensionless:\n\n$[\\frac{a{t}^{2}}{s}]=\\frac{[a]Â·{[t]}^{2}}{[s]}=\\frac{{\\text{LT}}^{â2}Â·{\\text{T}}^{2}}{\\text{L}}=\\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{L}}=1.[\\frac{a{t}^{2}}{s}]=\\frac{[a]Â·{[t]}^{2}}{[s]}=\\frac{{\\text{LT}}^{â2}Â·{\\text{T}}^{2}}{\\text{L}}=\\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{L}}=1.$\n\nThe argument is dimensionless. So far, so good. Now we need to check the dimensions of each of the two terms (that is, the left expression and the right expression) in the equation:\n\n$[v]={\\text{LT}}^{â1}[\\text{sin}(\\frac{a{t}^{2}}{s})]=1.[v]={\\text{LT}}^{â1}[\\text{sin}(\\frac{a{t}^{2}}{s})]=1.$\n\nThe two terms have different dimensionsâmeaning, the equation is not dimensionally consistent. This equation is another example of ânonsense.â\n\nSignificance\n\nIf we are trusting people, these types of dimensional checks might seem unnecessary. But, rest assured, any textbook on a quantitative subject such as physics (including this one) almost certainly contains some equations with typos. Checking equations routinely by dimensional analysis save us the embarrassment of using an incorrect equation. Also, checking the dimensions of an equation we obtain through algebraic manipulation is a great way to make sure we did not make a mistake (or to spot a mistake, if we made one).\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n1.6\n\nIs the equation\n\nv\n\n=\n\nat\n\ndimensionally consistent?\n\nOne further point that needs to be mentioned is the effect of the operations of calculus on dimensions. We have seen that dimensions obey the rules of algebra, just like units, but what happens when we take the derivative of one physical quantity with respect to another or integrate a physical quantity over another? The derivative of a function is just the slope of the line tangent to its graph and slopes are ratios, so for physical quantities\n\nv\n\nand\n\nt\n\n, we have that the dimension of the derivative of\n\nv\n\nwith respect to\n\nt\n\nis just the ratio of the dimension of\n\nv\n\nover that of\n\nt\n\n:\n\n$[\\frac{dv}{dt}]=\\frac{[v]}{[t]}.[\\frac{dv}{dt}]=\\frac{[v]}{[t]}.$\n\nSimilarly, since integrals are just sums of products, the dimension of the integral of\n\nv\n\nwith respect to\n\nt\n\nis simply the dimension of\n\nv\n\ntimes the dimension of\n\nt\n\n:\n\n$[â«vdt]=[v]Â·[t].[â«vdt]=[v]Â·[t].$\n\nBy the same reasoning, analogous rules hold for the units of physical quantities derived from other quantities by integration or differentiation."

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nEstimate the values of physical quantities.\n\nOn many occasions, physicists, other scientists, and engineers need to make\n\nestimates\n\nfor a particular quantity. Other terms sometimes used are\n\nguesstimates\n\n,\n\norder-of-magnitude approximations\n\n,\n\nback-of-the-envelope calculations\n\n, or\n\nFermi calculations\n\n. (The physicist Enrico Fermi mentioned earlier was famous for his ability to estimate various kinds of data with surprising precision.) Will that piece of equipment fit in the back of the car or do we need to rent a truck? How long will this download take? About how large a current will there be in this circuit when it is turned on? How many houses could a proposed power plant actually power if it is built? Note that estimating does not mean guessing a number or a formula at random. Rather,\n\nestimation\n\nmeans using prior experience and sound physical reasoning to arrive at a rough idea of a quantityâs value. Because the process of determining a reliable approximation usually involves the identification of correct physical principles and a good guess about the relevant variables, estimating is very useful in developing physical intuition. Estimates also allow us to perform âsanity checksâ on calculations or policy proposals by helping us rule out certain scenarios or unrealistic numbers. They allow us to challenge others (as well as ourselves) in our efforts to learn truths about the world.\n\nMany estimates are based on formulas in which the input quantities are known only to a limited precision. As you develop physics problem-solving skills (which are applicable to a wide variety of fields), you also will develop skills at estimating. You develop these skills by thinking quantitatively and being willing to take risks. As with any skill, experience helps. Familiarity with dimensions (see\n\nTable 1.3\n\n) and units (see\n\nTable 1.1\n\nand\n\nTable 1.2\n\n), and the scales of base quantities (see\n\nFigure 1.4\n\n) also helps.\n\nTo make some progress in estimating, you need to have some definite ideas about how variables may be related. The following strategies may help you in practicing the art of estimation:\n\nGet big lengths from smaller lengths.\n\nWhen estimating lengths, remember that anything can be a ruler. Thus, imagine breaking a big thing into smaller things, estimate the length of one of the smaller things, and multiply to get the length of the big thing. For example, to estimate the height of a building, first count how many floors it has. Then, estimate how big a single floor is by imagining how many people would have to stand on each otherâs shoulders to reach the ceiling. Last, estimate the height of a person. The product of these three estimates is your estimate of the height of the building. It helps to have memorized a few length scales relevant to the sorts of problems you find yourself solving. For example, knowing some of the length scales in\n\nFigure 1.4\n\nmight come in handy. Sometimes it also helps to do this in reverseâthat is, to estimate the length of a small thing, imagine a bunch of them making up a bigger thing. For example, to estimate the thickness of a sheet of paper, estimate the thickness of a stack of paper and then divide by the number of pages in the stack. These same strategies of breaking big things into smaller things or aggregating smaller things into a bigger thing can sometimes be used to estimate other physical quantities, such as masses and times.\n\nGet areas and volumes from lengths.\n\nWhen dealing with an area or a volume of a complex object, introduce a simple model of the object such as a sphere or a box. Then, estimate the linear dimensions (such as the radius of the sphere or the length, width, and height of the box) first, and use your estimates to obtain the volume or area from standard geometric formulas. If you happen to have an estimate of an objectâs area or volume, you can also do the reverse; that is, use standard geometric formulas to get an estimate of its linear dimensions.\n\nGet masses from volumes and densities.\n\nWhen estimating masses of objects, it can help first to estimate its volume and then to estimate its mass from a rough estimate of its average density (recall, density has dimension mass over length cubed, so mass is density times volume). For this, it helps to remember that the density of air is around 1 kg/m\n\n3\n\n, the density of water is 10\n\n3\n\nkg/m\n\n3\n\n, and the densest everyday solids max out at around 10\n\n4\n\nkg/m\n\n3\n\n. Asking yourself whether an object floats or sinks in either air or water gets you a ballpark estimate of its density. You can also do this the other way around; if you have an estimate of an objectâs mass and its density, you can use them to get an estimate of its volume.\n\nIf all else fails, bound it.\n\nFor physical quantities for which you do not have a lot of intuition, sometimes the best you can do is think something like: Well, it must be bigger than this and smaller than that. For example, suppose you need to estimate the mass of a moose. Maybe you have a lot of experience with moose and know their average mass offhand. If so, great. But for most people, the best they can do is to think something like: It must be bigger than a person (of order 10\n\n2\n\nkg) and less than a car (of order 10\n\n3\n\nkg). If you need a single number for a subsequent calculation, you can take the geometric mean of the upper and lower boundâthat is, you multiply them together and then take the square root. For the moose mass example, this would be\n\n${({10}^{2}Ã{10}^{3})}^{0.5}={10}^{2.5}={10}^{0.5}Ã{10}^{2}â3Ã{10}^{2}\\text{kg}.{({10}^{2}Ã{10}^{3})}^{0.5}={10}^{2.5}={10}^{0.5}Ã{10}^{2}â3Ã{10}^{2}\\text{kg}.$\n\nThe tighter the bounds, the better. Also, no rules are unbreakable when it comes to estimation. If you think the value of the quantity is likely to be closer to the upper bound than the lower bound, then you may want to bump up your estimate from the geometric mean by an order or two of magnitude.\n\nOne âsig. fig.â is fine.\n\nThere is no need to go beyond one significant figure, or one digit in the coefficient of an expression in scientific notation, when doing calculations to obtain an estimate. In most cases, the order of magnitude is good enough. The goal is just to get in the ballpark figure, so keep the arithmetic as simple as possible.\n\nAsk yourself: Does this make any sense?\n\nLast, check to see whether your answer is reasonable. How does it compare with the values of other quantities with the same dimensions that you already know or can look up easily? If you get some wacky answer (for example, if you estimate the mass of the Atlantic Ocean to be bigger than the mass of Earth, or some time span to be longer than the age of the universe), first check to see whether your units are correct. Then, check for arithmetic errors. Then, rethink the logic you used to arrive at your answer. If everything checks out, you may have just proved that some slick new idea is actually bogus.\n\nExample\n\n1.6\n\nMass of Earthâs Oceans\n\nEstimate the total mass of the oceans on Earth.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe know the density of water is about 10\n\n3\n\nkg/m\n\n3\n\n, so we start with the advice to âget masses from densities and volumes.â Thus, we need to estimate the volume of the planetâs oceans. Using the advice to âget areas and volumes from lengths,â we can estimate the volume of the oceans as surface area times average depth, or\n\nV\n\n=\n\nAD\n\n. We know the diameter of Earth from\n\nFigure 1.4\n\nand we know that most of Earthâs surface is covered in water, so we can estimate the surface area of the oceans as being roughly equal to the surface area of the planet. By following the advice to âget areas and volumes from lengthsâ again, we can approximate Earth as a sphere and use the formula for the surface area of a sphere of diameter\n\nd\n\nâthat is,\n\n$A=Ï{d}^{2},A=Ï{d}^{2},$\n\nto estimate the surface area of the oceans. Now we just need to estimate the average depth of the oceans. For this, we use the advice: âIf all else fails, bound it.â We happen to know the deepest points in the ocean are around 10 km and that it is not uncommon for the ocean to be deeper than 1 km, so we take the average depth to be around\n\n${({10}^{3}Ã{10}^{4})}^{0.5}â3Ã{10}^{3}\\text{m.}{({10}^{3}Ã{10}^{4})}^{0.5}â3Ã{10}^{3}\\text{m.}$\n\nNow we just need to put it all together, heeding the advice that âone âsig. fig.â is fine.â\n\nSolution\n\nWe estimate the surface area of Earth (and hence the surface area of Earthâs oceans) to be roughly\n\n$A=Ï{d}^{2}=Ï{({10}^{7}\\text{m})}^{2}â3Ã{10}^{14}{\\text{m}}^{2}.A=Ï{d}^{2}=Ï{({10}^{7}\\text{m})}^{2}â3Ã{10}^{14}{\\text{m}}^{2}.$\n\nNext, using our average depth estimate of\n\n$D=3Ã{10}^{3}\\text{m,}D=3Ã{10}^{3}\\text{m,}$\n\nwhich was obtained by bounding, we estimate the volume of Earthâs oceans to be\n\n$V=AD=(3Ã{10}^{14}{\\text{m}}^{2})(3Ã{10}^{3}\\text{m})=9Ã{10}^{17}{\\text{m}}^{3}.V=AD=(3Ã{10}^{14}{\\text{m}}^{2})(3Ã{10}^{3}\\text{m})=9Ã{10}^{17}{\\text{m}}^{3}.$\n\nLast, we estimate the mass of the worldâs oceans to be\n\n$M=ÏV=({10}^{3}{\\text{kg/m}}^{3})(9Ã{10}^{17}{\\text{m}}^{3})=9Ã{10}^{20}\\text{kg}.M=ÏV=({10}^{3}{\\text{kg/m}}^{3})(9Ã{10}^{17}{\\text{m}}^{3})=9Ã{10}^{20}\\text{kg}.$\n\nThus, we estimate that the order of magnitude of the mass of the planetâs oceans is 10\n\n21\n\nkg.\n\nSignificance\n\nTo verify our answer to the best of our ability, we first need to answer the question: Does this make any sense? From\n\nFigure 1.4\n\n, we see the mass of Earthâs atmosphere is on the order of 10\n\n19\n\nkg and the mass of Earth is on the order of 10\n\n25\n\nkg. It is reassuring that our estimate of 10\n\n21\n\nkg for the mass of Earthâs oceans falls somewhere between these two. So, yes, it does seem to make sense. It just so happens that we did a search on the Web for âmass of oceansâ and the top search results all said\n\n$1.4Ã{10}^{21}\\text{kg,}1.4Ã{10}^{21}\\text{kg,}$\n\nwhich is the same order of magnitude as our estimate. Now, rather than having to trust blindly whoever first put that number up on a website (most of the other sites probably just copied it from them, after all), we can have a little more confidence in it.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n1.7\n\nFigure 1.4\n\nsays the mass of the atmosphere is 10\n\n19\n\nkg. Assuming the density of the atmosphere is 1 kg/m\n\n3\n\n, estimate the height of Earthâs atmosphere. Do you think your answer is an underestimate or an overestimate? Explain why.\n\nHow many piano tuners are there in New York City? How many leaves are on that tree? If you are studying photosynthesis or thinking of writing a smartphone app for piano tuners, then the answers to these questions might be of great interest to you. Otherwise, you probably couldnât care less what the answers are. However, these are exactly the sorts of estimation problems that people in various tech industries have been asking potential employees to evaluate their quantitative reasoning skills. If building physical intuition and evaluating quantitative claims do not seem like sufficient reasons for you to practice estimation problems, how about the fact that being good at them just might land you a high-paying job?\n\nInteractive\n\nFor practice estimating relative lengths, areas, and volumes, check out this\n\nPhET\n\nsimulation, titled âEstimation.â"

The digital scale has mostly replaced the double-pan balance in physics labs because it gives more accurate and precise measurements. But what exactly do we mean by\n\naccurate\n\nand\n\nprecise\n\n? Arenât they the same thing? In this section we examine in detail the process of making and reporting a measurement.\n\nFigure\n\n1.11\n\n(a) A double-pan mechanical balance is used to compare different masses. Usually an object with unknown mass is placed in one pan and objects of known mass are placed in the other pan. When the bar that connects the two pans is horizontal, then the masses in both pans are equal. The âknown massesâ are typically metal cylinders of standard mass such as 1 g, 10 g, and 100 g. (b) Many mechanical balances, such as double-pan balances, have been replaced by digital scales, which can typically measure the mass of an object more precisely. A mechanical balance may read only the mass of an object to the nearest tenth of a gram, but many digital scales can measure the mass of an object up to the nearest thousandth of a gram. (credit a: modification of work by Serge Melki; credit b: modification of work by Karel Jakubec)\n\nAccuracy and Precision of a Measurement\n\nScience is based on observation and experimentâthat is, on measurements.\n\nAccuracy\n\nis how close a measurement is to the accepted reference value for that measurement. For example, letâs say we want to measure the length of standard printer paper. The packaging in which we purchased the paper states that it is 11.0 in. long. We then measure the length of the paper three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 in., 11.2 in., and 10.9 in. These measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the reference value of 11.0 in. In contrast, if we had obtained a measurement of 12 in., our measurement would not be very accurate. Notice that the concept of\n\naccuracy\n\nrequires that an accepted reference value be given.\n\nThe\n\nprecision\n\nof measurements refers to how close the agreement is between repeated independent measurements (which are repeated under the same conditions). Consider the example of the paper measurements. The precision of the measurements refers to the spread of the measured values. One way to analyze the precision of the measurements is to determine the range, or difference, between the lowest and the highest measured values. In this case, the lowest value was 10.9 in. and the highest value was 11.2 in. Thus, the measured values deviated from each other by, at most, 0.3 in. These measurements were relatively precise because they did not vary too much in value. However, if the measured values had been 10.9 in., 11.1 in., and 11.9 in., then the measurements would not be very precise because there would be significant variation from one measurement to another. Notice that the concept of precision depends only on the actual measurements acquired and does not depend on an accepted reference value.\n\nThe measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements are accurate but not precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Letâs consider an example of a GPS attempting to locate the position of a restaurant in a city. Think of the restaurant location as existing at the center of a bullâs-eye target and think of each GPS attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot. In\n\nFigure 1.12\n\n(a), we see the GPS measurements are spread out far apart from each other, but they are all relatively close to the actual location of the restaurant at the center of the target. This indicates a low-precision, high-accuracy measuring system. However, in\n\nFigure 1.12\n\n(b), the GPS measurements are concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far away from the target location. This indicates a high-precision, low-accuracy measuring system.\n\nFigure\n\n1.12\n\nA GPS attempts to locate a restaurant at the center of the bullâs-eye. The black dots represent each attempt to pinpoint the location of the restaurant. (a) The dots are spread out quite far apart from one another, indicating low precision, but they are each rather close to the actual location of the restaurant, indicating high accuracy. (b) The dots are concentrated rather closely to one another, indicating high precision, but they are rather far away from the actual location of the restaurant, indicating low accuracy. (credit a and credit b: modification of works by \"DarkEvil\"/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nAccuracy, Precision, Uncertainty, and Discrepancy\n\nThe precision of a measuring system is related to the\n\nuncertainty\n\nin the measurements whereas the accuracy is related to the\n\ndiscrepancy\n\nfrom the accepted reference value. Uncertainty is a quantitative measure of how much your measured values deviate from one another. There are many different methods of calculating uncertainty, each of which is appropriate to different situations. Some examples include taking the range (that is, the largest minus the smallest) or finding the standard deviation of the measurements. Discrepancy (or âmeasurement errorâ) is the difference between the measured value and a given standard or expected value. If the measurements are not very precise, then the uncertainty of the values is high. If the measurements are not very accurate, then the discrepancy of the values is high.\n\nRecall our example of measuring paper length; we obtained measurements of 11.1 in., 11.2 in., and 10.9 in., and the accepted value was 11.0 in. We might average the three measurements to say our best guess is 11.1 in.; in this case, our discrepancy is 11.1 â 11.0 = 0.1 in., which provides a quantitative measure of accuracy. We might calculate the uncertainty in our best guess by using half of the range of our measured values: 0.15 in. Then we would say the length of the paper is 11.1 in. plus or minus 0.15 in. The uncertainty in a measurement,\n\nA\n\n, is often denoted as\n\nÎ´A\n\n(read âdelta\n\nA\n\nâ), so the measurement result would be recorded as\n\nA\n\nÂ±\n\nÎ´A\n\n. Returning to our paper example, the measured length of the paper could be expressed as 11.1 Â± 0.15 in. Since the discrepancy of 0.1 in. is less than the uncertainty of 0.15 in., we might say the measured value agrees with the accepted reference value to within experimental uncertainty.\n\nSome factors that contribute to uncertainty in a measurement include the following:\n\nLimitations of the measuring device\n\nThe skill of the person taking the measurement\n\nIrregularities in the object being measured\n\nAny other factors that affect the outcome (highly dependent on the situation)\n\nIn our example, such factors contributing to the uncertainty could be the smallest division on the ruler is 1/16 in., the person using the ruler has bad eyesight, the ruler is worn down on one end, or one side of the paper is slightly longer than the other. At any rate, the uncertainty in a measurement must be calculated to quantify its precision. If a reference value is known, it makes sense to calculate the discrepancy as well to quantify its accuracy.\n\nPercent uncertainty\n\nAnother method of expressing uncertainty is as a percent of the measured value. If a measurement\n\nA\n\nis expressed with uncertainty\n\nÎ´A\n\n, the\n\npercent uncertainty\n\nis defined as\n\n$\\text{Percent uncertainty}=\\frac{Î´A}{A}Ã100%.\\text{Percent uncertainty}=\\frac{Î´A}{A}Ã100%.$\n\nExample\n\n1.7\n\nCalculating Percent Uncertainty: A Bag of Apples\n\nA grocery store sells 5-lb bags of apples. Letâs say we purchase four bags during the course of a month and weigh the bags each time. We obtain the following measurements:\n\nWeek 1 weight: 4.8 lb\n\nWeek 2 weight: 5.3 lb\n\nWeek 3 weight: 4.9 lb\n\nWeek 4 weight: 5.4 lb\n\nWe then determine the average weight of the 5-lb bag of apples is 5.1 Â± 0.3 lb from using half of the range. What is the percent uncertainty of the bagâs weight?\n\nStrategy\n\nFirst, observe that the average value of the bagâs weight,\n\nA\n\n, is 5.1 lb. The uncertainty in this value,\n\n$Î´A,Î´A,$\n\nis 0.3 lb. We can use the following equation to determine the percent uncertainty of the weight:\n\n$\\text{Percent uncertainty}=\\frac{Î´A}{A}Ã100%.\\text{Percent uncertainty}=\\frac{Î´A}{A}Ã100%.$\n\n1.1\n\nSolution\n\nSubstitute the values into the equation:\n\n$\\text{Percent uncertainty}=\\frac{Î´A}{A}Ã100%=\\frac{0.3\\text{lb}}{5.1\\text{lb}}Ã100%=5.9%â6%.\\text{Percent uncertainty}=\\frac{Î´A}{A}Ã100%=\\frac{0.3\\text{lb}}{5.1\\text{lb}}Ã100%=5.9%â6%.$\n\nSignificance\n\nWe can conclude the average weight of a bag of apples from this store is 5.1 lb Â± 6%. Notice the percent uncertainty is dimensionless because the units of weight in\n\n$Î´A=0.2Î´A=0.2$\n\nlb canceled those in\n\nA\n\n= 5.1 lb when we took the ratio.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n1.8\n\nA high school track coach has just purchased a new stopwatch. The stopwatch manual states the stopwatch has an uncertainty of Â±0.05 s. Runners on the track coachâs team regularly clock 100-m sprints of 11.49 s to 15.01 s. At the schoolâs last track meet, the first-place sprinter came in at 12.04 s and the second-place sprinter came in at 12.07 s. Will the coachâs new stopwatch be helpful in timing the sprint team? Why or why not?\n\nUncertainties in calculations\n\nUncertainty exists in anything calculated from measured quantities. For example, the area of a floor calculated from measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the length and width have uncertainties. How big is the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division? If the measurements going into the calculation have small uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the\n\nmethod of adding percents\n\ncan be used for multiplication or division. This method states\n\nthe percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation\n\n. For example, if a floor has a length of 4.00 m and a width of 3.00 m, with uncertainties of 2% and 1%, respectively, then the area of the floor is 12.0 m\n\n2\n\nand has an uncertainty of 3%. (Expressed as an area, this is 0.36 m\n\n2\n\n[\n\n$12.0{\\text{m}}^{2}Ã0.0312.0{\\text{m}}^{2}Ã0.03$\n\n], which we round to 0.4 m\n\n2\n\nsince the area of the floor is given to a tenth of a square meter.)\n\nPrecision of Measuring Tools and Significant Figures\n\nAn important factor in the precision of measurements involves the precision of the measuring tool. In general, a precise measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, a standard ruler can measure length to the nearest millimeter whereas a caliper can measure length to the nearest 0.01 mm. The caliper is a more precise measuring tool because it can measure extremely small differences in length. The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise the measurements.\n\nWhen we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we measured initially with our measuring tool. For example, if we use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, we may measure it to be 36.7 cm. We canât express this value as 36.71 cm because our measuring tool is not precise enough to measure a hundredth of a centimeter. It should be noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way by the person performing the measurement. For example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler notices the stick length seems to be somewhere in between 36.6 cm and 36.7 cm, and he or she must estimate the value of the last digit. Using the method of\n\nsignificant figures\n\n, the rule is that\n\nthe last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty\n\n. To determine the number of significant digits in a value, start with the first measured value at the left and count the number of digits through the last digit written on the right. For example, the measured value 36.7 cm has three digits, or three significant figures. Significant figures indicate the precision of the measuring tool used to measure a value.\n\nZeros\n\nSpecial consideration is given to zeros when counting significant figures. The zeros in 0.053 are not significant because they are placeholders that locate the decimal point. There are two significant figures in 0.053. The zeros in 10.053 are not placeholders; they are significant. This number has five significant figures. The zeros in 1300 may or may not be significant, depending on the style of writing numbers. They could mean the number is known to the last digit or they could be placeholders. So 1300 could have two, three, or four significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, we should write 1300 in scientific notation as\n\n$1.3Ã{10}^{3},1.3Ã{10}^{3},$\n\n$1.30Ã{10}^{3},1.30Ã{10}^{3},$\n\nor\n\n$1.300Ã{10}^{3},1.300Ã{10}^{3},$\n\ndepending on whether it has two, three, or four significant figures.\n\nZeros are significant except when they serve only as placeholders\n\n.\n\nSignificant figures in calculations\n\nWhen combining measurements with different degrees of precision with the mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, then\n\nthe number of significant digits in the final answer can be no greater than the number of significant digits in the least-precise measured value\n\n. There are two different rules, one for multiplication and division and the other for addition and subtraction.\n\nFor multiplication and division, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the quantity with the least number of significant figures entering into the calculation\n\n. For example, the area of a circle can be calculated from its radius using\n\nA\n\n=\n\nÏr\n\n2\n\n. Letâs see how many significant figures the area has if the radius has only twoâsay,\n\nr\n\n= 1.2 m. Using a calculator with an eight-digit output, we would calculate\n\n$A=Ï{r}^{2}=(3.1415927\\text{â¦})Ã{(1.2\\text{m})}^{2}=4.5238934{\\text{m}}^{2}.A=Ï{r}^{2}=(3.1415927\\text{â¦})Ã{(1.2\\text{m})}^{2}=4.5238934{\\text{m}}^{2}.$\n\nBut because the radius has only two significant figures, it limits the calculated quantity to two significant figures, or\n\n$A=4.5{\\text{m}}^{2},A=4.5{\\text{m}}^{2},$\n\nalthough\n\nÏ\n\nis good to at least eight digits.\n\nFor addition and subtraction, the answer can contain no more decimal places than the least-precise measurement.\n\nSuppose we buy 7.56 kg of potatoes in a grocery store as measured with a scale with precision 0.01 kg, then we drop off 6.052 kg of potatoes at your laboratory as measured by a scale with precision 0.001 kg. Then, we go home and add 13.7 kg of potatoes as measured by a bathroom scale with precision 0.1 kg. How many kilograms of potatoes do we now have and how many significant figures are appropriate in the answer? The mass is found by simple addition and subtraction:\n\n$7.56\\text{kg}â6.052\\text{kg}+13.7\\text{kg}=15.208\\text{kg}7.56\\text{kg}â6.052\\text{kg}+13.7\\text{kg}=15.208\\text{kg}$\n\nNext, we identify the least-precise measurement: 13.7 kg. This measurement is expressed to the 0.1 decimal place, so our final answer must also be expressed to the 0.1 decimal place. Thus, the answer is rounded to the tenths place, giving us 15.2 kg.\n\nSignificant figures in this text\n\nIn this text, most numbers are assumed to have three significant figures. Furthermore, consistent numbers of significant figures are used in all worked examples. An answer given to three digits is based on input good to at least three digits, for example. If the input has fewer significant figures, the answer will also have fewer significant figures. Care is also taken that the number of significant figures is reasonable for the situation posed. In some topics, particularly in optics, more accurate numbers are needed and we use more than three significant figures. Finally, if a number is\n\nexact\n\n, such as the two in the formula for the circumference of a circle,\n\nC\n\n= 2Ï\n\nr\n\n, it does not affect the number of significant figures in a calculation. Likewise, conversion factors such as 100 cm/1 m are considered exact and do not affect the number of significant figures in a calculation."

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nDescribe the process for developing a problem-solving strategy.\n\nExplain how to find the numerical solution to a problem.\n\nSummarize the process for assessing the significance of the numerical solution to a problem.\n\nFigure\n\n1.13\n\nProblem-solving skills are essential to your success in physics. (credit: âscui3asteveoâ/Flickr)\n\nProblem-solving skills are clearly essential to success in a quantitative course in physics. More important, the ability to apply broad physical principlesâusually represented by equationsâto specific situations is a very powerful form of knowledge. It is much more powerful than memorizing a list of facts. Analytical skills and problem-solving abilities can be applied to new situations whereas a list of facts cannot be made long enough to contain every possible circumstance. Such analytical skills are useful both for solving problems in this text and for applying physics in everyday life.\n\nAs you are probably well aware, a certain amount of creativity and insight is required to solve problems. No rigid procedure works every time. Creativity and insight grow with experience. With practice, the basics of problem solving become almost automatic. One way to get practice is to work out the textâs examples for yourself as you read. Another is to work as many end-of-section problems as possible, starting with the easiest to build confidence and then progressing to the more difficult. After you become involved in physics, you will see it all around you, and you can begin to apply it to situations you encounter outside the classroom, just as is done in many of the applications in this text.\n\nAlthough there is no simple step-by-step method that works for every problem, the following three-stage process facilitates problem solving and makes it more meaningful. The three stages are strategy, solution, and significance. This process is used in examples throughout the book. Here, we look at each stage of the process in turn.\n\nStrategy\n\nStrategy is the beginning stage of solving a problem. The idea is to figure out exactly what the problem is and then develop a strategy for solving it. Some general advice for this stage is as follows:\n\nExamine the situation to determine which physical principles are involved\n\n. It often helps to\n\ndraw a simple sketch\n\nat the outset. You often need to decide which direction is positive and note that on your sketch. When you have identified the physical principles, it is much easier to find and apply the equations representing those principles. Although finding the correct equation is essential, keep in mind that equations represent physical principles, laws of nature, and relationships among physical quantities. Without a conceptual understanding of a problem, a numerical solution is meaningless.\n\nMake a list of what is given or can be inferred from the problem as stated (identify the âknownsâ)\n\n. Many problems are stated very succinctly and require some inspection to determine what is known. Drawing a sketch can be very useful at this point as well. Formally identifying the knowns is of particular importance in applying physics to real-world situations. For example, the word\n\nstopped\n\nmeans the velocity is zero at that instant. Also, we can often take initial time and position as zero by the appropriate choice of coordinate system.\n\nIdentify exactly what needs to be determined in the problem (identify the unknowns)\n\n. In complex problems, especially, it is not always obvious what needs to be found or in what sequence. Making a list can help identify the unknowns.\n\nDetermine which physical principles can help you solve the problem\n\n. Since physical principles tend to be expressed in the form of mathematical equations, a list of knowns and unknowns can help here. It is easiest if you can find equations that contain only one unknownâthat is, all the other variables are knownâso you can solve for the unknown easily. If the equation contains more than one unknown, then additional equations are needed to solve the problem. In some problems, several unknowns must be determined to get at the one needed most. In such problems it is especially important to keep physical principles in mind to avoid going astray in a sea of equations. You may have to use two (or more) different equations to get the final answer.\n\nSolution\n\nThe solution stage is when you do the math.\n\nSubstitute the knowns (along with their units) into the appropriate equation and obtain numerical solutions complete with units\n\n. That is, do the algebra, calculus, geometry, or arithmetic necessary to find the unknown from the knowns, being sure to carry the units through the calculations. This step is clearly important because it produces the numerical answer, along with its units. Notice, however, that this stage is only one-third of the overall problem-solving process.\n\nSignificance\n\nAfter having done the math in the solution stage of problem solving, it is tempting to think you are done. But, always remember that physics is not math. Rather, in doing physics, we use mathematics as a tool to help us understand nature. So, after you obtain a numerical answer, you should always assess its significance:\n\nCheck your units.\n\nIf the units of the answer are incorrect, then an error has been made and you should go back over your previous steps to find it. One way to find the mistake is to check all the equations you derived for dimensional consistency. However, be warned that correct units do not guarantee the numerical part of the answer is also correct.\n\nCheck the answer to see whether it is reasonable. Does it make sense?\n\nThis step is extremely important: the goal of physics is to describe nature accurately. To determine whether the answer is reasonable, check both its magnitude and its sign, in addition to its units. The magnitude should be consistent with a rough estimate of what it should be. It should also compare reasonably with magnitudes of other quantities of the same type. The sign usually tells you about direction and should be consistent with your prior expectations. Your judgment will improve as you solve more physics problems, and it will become possible for you to make finer judgments regarding whether nature is described adequately by the answer to a problem. This step brings the problem back to its conceptual meaning. If you can judge whether the answer is reasonable, you have a deeper understanding of physics than just being able to solve a problem mechanically.\n\nCheck to see whether the answer tells you something interesting. What does it mean?\n\nThis is the flip side of the question: Does it make sense? Ultimately, physics is about understanding nature, and we solve physics problems to learn a little something about how nature operates. Therefore, assuming the answer does make sense, you should always take a moment to see if it tells you something about the world that you find interesting. Even if the answer to this particular problem is not very interesting to you, what about the method you used to solve it? Could the method be adapted to answer a question that you do find interesting? In many ways, it is in answering questions such as these that science progresses."

    "chapter": 1,
    "content": "Challenge Problems\n\n88\n\n.\n\nThe first atomic bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945, at the Trinity test site about 200 mi south of Los Alamos. In 1947, the U.S. government declassified a film reel of the explosion. From this film reel, British physicist G. I. Taylor was able to determine the rate at which the radius of the fireball from the blast grew. Using dimensional analysis, he was then able to deduce the amount of energy released in the explosion, which was a closely guarded secret at the time. Because of this, Taylor did not publish his results until 1950. This problem challenges you to recreate this famous calculation. (a) Using keen physical insight developed from years of experience, Taylor decided the radius\n\nr\n\nof the fireball should depend only on the following variables:\n\nt\n\n, the time since the explosion,\n\n$Ï,Ï,$\n\nand the density of the air,\n\nE\n\n, the energy of the inital explosion.\n\nThus, he made the educated guess that\n\n$r=k{E}^{a}{Ï}^{b}{t}^{c}r=k{E}^{a}{Ï}^{b}{t}^{c}$\n\nfor some dimensionless constant\n\nk\n\nand some unknown exponents\n\na\n\n,\n\nb\n\n, and\n\nc\n\n. Given that [E] = ML\n\n2\n\nT\n\nâ2\n\n, determine the values of the exponents necessary to make this equation dimensionally consistent. (\n\nHint\n\n: Notice the equation implies that\n\n$k=r{E}^{\\text{â}a}{Ï}^{\\text{â}b}{t}^{\\text{â}c}k=r{E}^{\\text{â}a}{Ï}^{\\text{â}b}{t}^{\\text{â}c}$\n\nand that\n\n$[k]=1.[k]=1.$\n\n) (b) By analyzing data from high-energy conventional explosives, Taylor found the formula he derived seemed to be valid as long as the constant\n\nk\n\nhad the value 1.03. From the film reel, he was able to determine many values of\n\nr\n\nand the corresponding values of\n\nt\n\n. For example, he found that after 25.0 ms, the fireball had a radius of 130.0 m. Use these values, along with an average air density of 1.25 kg/m\n\n3\n\n, to calculate the initial energy release of the Trinity detonation in joules (J). (\n\nHint\n\n: To get energy in joules, you need to make sure all the numbers you substitute in are expressed in terms of SI base units.) (c) The energy released in large explosions is often cited in units of âtons of TNTâ (abbreviated ât TNTâ), where 1 t TNT is about 4.2 GJ. Convert your answer to (b) into kilotons of TNT (that is, kt TNT). Compare your answer with the quick-and-dirty estimate of 10 kt TNT made by physicist Enrico Fermi shortly after witnessing the explosion from what was thought to be a safe distance. (Reportedly, Fermi made his estimate by dropping some shredded bits of paper right before the remnants of the shock wave hit him and looked to see how far they were carried by it.)\n\n89\n\n.\n\nThe purpose of this problem is to show the entire concept of dimensional consistency can be summarized by the old saying âYou canât add apples and oranges.â If you have studied power series expansions in a calculus course, you know the standard mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponential functions can be expressed as infinite sums of the form\n\n$ân=0â{a}_{n}{x}^{n}={a}_{0}+{a}_{1}x+{a}_{2}{x}^{2}+{a}_{3}{x}^{3}+â¯,ân=0â{a}_{n}{x}^{n}={a}_{0}+{a}_{1}x+{a}_{2}{x}^{2}+{a}_{3}{x}^{3}+â¯,$\n\nwhere the\n\n${a}_{n}{a}_{n}$\n\nare dimensionless constants for all\n\n$n=0,1,2,â¯n=0,1,2,â¯$\n\nand\n\nx\n\nis the argument of the function. (If you have not studied power series in calculus yet, just trust us.) Use this fact to explain why the requirement that all terms in an equation have the same dimensions is sufficient as a definition of dimensional consistency. That is, it actually implies the arguments of standard mathematical functions must be dimensionless, so it is not really necessary to make this latter condition a separate requirement of the definition of dimensional consistency as we have done in this section."

Without knowing the size of the object in units we all recognize, such as meters or inches, it is difficult to know what weâre looking at. In fact, this image shows the Whirlpool Galaxy (and its companion galaxy), which is about 60,000 light-years in diameter (about\n\n$6Ã{10}^{17}\\text{km}6Ã{10}^{17}\\text{km}$\n\nacross).

Galaxies are as immense as atoms are small, yet the same laws of physics describe both, along with all the rest of natureâan indication of the underlying unity in the universe. The laws of physics are surprisingly few, implying an underlying simplicity to natureâs apparent complexity. In this text, you learn about the laws of physics. Galaxies and atoms may seem far removed from your daily life, but as you begin to explore this broad-ranging subject, you may soon come to realize that physics plays a much larger role in your life than you first thought, no matter your life goals or career choice."

    "chapter": 1,
    "content": "Summary\n\n1.1\n\nThe Scope and Scale of Physics\n\nPhysics is about trying to find the simple laws that describe all natural phenomena.\n\nPhysics operates on a vast range of scales of length, mass, and time. Scientists use the concept of the order of magnitude of a number to track which phenomena occur on which scales. They also use orders of magnitude to compare the various scales.\n\nScientists attempt to describe the world by formulating models, theories, and laws.\n\n1.2\n\nUnits and Standards\n\nSystems of units are built up from a small number of base units, which are defined by accurate and precise measurements of conventionally chosen base quantities. Other units are then derived as algebraic combinations of the base units.\n\nTwo commonly used systems of units are English units and SI units. All scientists and most of the other people in the world use SI, whereas nonscientists in the United States still tend to use English units.\n\nThe SI base units of length, mass, and time are the meter (m), kilogram (kg), and second (s), respectively.\n\nSI units are a metric system of units, meaning values can be calculated by factors of 10. Metric prefixes may be used with metric units to scale the base units to sizes appropriate for almost any application.\n\n1.3\n\nUnit Conversion\n\nTo convert a quantity from one unit to another, multiply by conversion factors in such a way that you cancel the units you want to get rid of and introduce the units you want to end up with.\n\nBe careful with areas and volumes. Units obey the rules of algebra so, for example, if a unit is squared we need two factors to cancel it.\n\n1.4\n\nDimensional Analysis\n\nThe dimension of a physical quantity is just an expression of the base quantities from which it is derived.\n\nAll equations expressing physical laws or principles must be dimensionally consistent. This fact can be used as an aid in remembering physical laws, as a way to check whether claimed relationships between physical quantities are possible, and even to derive new physical laws.\n\n1.5\n\nEstimates and Fermi Calculations\n\nAn estimate is a rough educated guess at the value of a physical quantity based on prior experience and sound physical reasoning. Some strategies that may help when making an estimate are as follows:\n\nGet big lengths from smaller lengths.\n\nGet areas and volumes from lengths.\n\nGet masses from volumes and densities.\n\nIf all else fails, bound it.\n\nOne âsig. fig.â is fine.\n\nAsk yourself: Does this make any sense?\n\n1.6\n\nSignificant Figures\n\nAccuracy of a measured value refers to how close a measurement is to an accepted reference value. The discrepancy in a measurement is the amount by which the measurement result differs from this value.\n\nPrecision of measured values refers to how close the agreement is between repeated measurements. The uncertainty of a measurement is a quantification of this.\n\nThe precision of a measuring tool is related to the size of its measurement increments. The smaller the measurement increment, the more precise the tool.\n\nSignificant figures express the precision of a measuring tool.\n\nWhen multiplying or dividing measured values, the final answer can contain only as many significant figures as the value with the least number of significant figures.\n\nWhen adding or subtracting measured values, the final answer cannot contain more decimal places than the least-precise value.\n\n1.7\n\nSolving Problems in Physics\n\nThe three stages of the process for solving physics problems used in this book are as follows:\n\nStrategy\n\n: Determine which physical principles are involved and develop a strategy for using them to solve the problem.\n\nSolution\n\n: Do the math necessary to obtain a numerical solution complete with units.\n\nSignificance\n\n: Check the solution to make sure it makes sense (correct units, reasonable magnitude and sign) and assess its significance."

    "title": "2.1Scalars and Vectors",
    "chapter": 2,
    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nDescribe the difference between vector and scalar quantities.\n\nIdentify the magnitude and direction of a vector.\n\nExplain the effect of multiplying a vector quantity by a scalar.\n\nDescribe how one-dimensional vector quantities are added or subtracted.\n\nExplain the geometric construction for the addition or subtraction of vectors in a plane.\n\nDistinguish between a vector equation and a scalar equation.\n\nMany familiar physical quantities can be specified completely by giving a single number and the appropriate unit. For example, âa class period lasts 50 minâ or âthe gas tank in my car holds 65 Lâ or âthe distance between two posts is 100 m.â A physical quantity that can be specified completely in this manner is called a\n\nscalar quantity\n\n. Scalar is a synonym of ânumber.â Time, mass, distance, length, volume, temperature, and energy are examples of\n\nscalar\n\nquantities.\n\nScalar quantities that have the same physical units can be added or subtracted according to the usual rules of algebra for numbers. For example, a class ending 10 min earlier than 50 min lasts\n\n$50\\text{min}â10\\text{min}=40\\text{min}50\\text{min}â10\\text{min}=40\\text{min}$\n\n. Similarly, a 60-cal serving of corn followed by a 200-cal serving of donuts gives\n\n$60\\text{cal}+200\\text{cal}=260\\text{cal}60\\text{cal}+200\\text{cal}=260\\text{cal}$\n\nof energy. When we multiply a scalar quantity by a number, we obtain the same scalar quantity but with a larger (or smaller) value. For example, if yesterdayâs breakfast had 200 cal of energy and todayâs breakfast has four times as much energy as it had yesterday, then todayâs breakfast has\n\n$4(200\\text{cal})=800\\text{cal}4(200\\text{cal})=800\\text{cal}$\n\nof energy. Two scalar quantities can also be multiplied or divided by each other to form a derived scalar quantity. For example, if a train covers a distance of 100 km in 1.0 h, its speed is 100.0 km/1.0 h = 27.8 m/s, where the speed is a derived scalar quantity obtained by dividing distance by time.\n\nMany physical quantities, however, cannot be described completely by just a single number of physical units. For example, when the U.S. Coast Guard dispatches a ship or a helicopter for a rescue mission, the rescue team must know not only the distance to the distress signal, but also the direction from which the signal is coming so they can get to its origin as quickly as possible. Physical quantities specified completely by giving a number of units (magnitude) and a direction are called\n\nvector quantities\n\n. Examples of vector quantities include displacement, velocity, position, force, and torque. In the language of mathematics, physical vector quantities are represented by mathematical objects called\n\nvectors\n\n(\n\nFigure 2.2\n\n). We can add or subtract two vectors, and we can multiply a vector by a scalar or by another vector, but we cannot divide by a vector. The operation of division by a vector is not defined.\n\nFigure\n\n2.2\n\nWe draw a vector from the initial point or origin (called the âtailâ of a vector) to the end or terminal point (called the âheadâ of a vector), marked by an arrowhead. Magnitude is the length of a vector and is always a positive scalar quantity. (credit \"photo\": modification of work by Cate Sevilla)\n\nLetâs examine vector algebra using a graphical method to be aware of basic terms and to develop a qualitative understanding. In practice, however, when it comes to solving physics problems, we use analytical methods, which weâll see in the next section. Analytical methods are more simple computationally and more accurate than graphical methods. From now on, to distinguish between a vector and a scalar quantity, we adopt the common convention that a letter in bold type with an arrow above it denotes a vector, and a letter without an arrow denotes a scalar. For example, a distance of 2.0 km, which is a scalar quantity, is denoted by\n\nd\n\n= 2.0 km, whereas a displacement of 2.0 km in some direction, which is a vector quantity, is denoted by\n\n$dâdâ$\n\n.\n\nSuppose you tell a friend on a camping trip that you have discovered a terrific fishing hole 6 km from your tent. It is unlikely your friend would be able to find the hole easily unless you also communicate the direction in which it can be found with respect to your campsite. You may say, for example, âWalk about 6 km northeast from my tent.â The key concept here is that you have to give not one but\n\ntwo\n\npieces of informationânamely, the distance or magnitude (6 km)\n\nand\n\nthe direction (northeast).\n\nDisplacement is a general term used to describe a\n\nchange in position\n\n, such as during a trip from the tent to the fishing hole. Displacement is an example of a vector quantity. If you walk from the tent (location\n\nA\n\n) to the hole (location\n\nB\n\n), as shown in\n\nFigure 2.3\n\n, the vector\n\n$DâDâ$\n\n, representing your\n\ndisplacement\n\n, is drawn as the arrow that originates at point\n\nA\n\nand ends at point\n\nB\n\n. The arrowhead marks the end of the vector. The direction of the displacement vector\n\n$DâDâ$\n\nis the direction of the arrow. The length of the arrow represents the\n\nmagnitude\n\nD\n\nof vector\n\n$DâDâ$\n\n. Here,\n\nD\n\n= 6 km. Since the magnitude of a vector is its length, which is a positive number, the magnitude is also indicated by placing the absolute value notation around the symbol that denotes the vector; so, we can write equivalently that\n\n$Dâ¡|Dâ|Dâ¡|Dâ|$\n\n. To solve a vector problem graphically, we need to draw the vector\n\n$DâDâ$\n\nto scale. For example, if we assume 1 unit of distance (1 km) is represented in the drawing by a line segment of length\n\nu\n\n= 2 cm, then the total displacement in this example is represented by a vector of length\n\n$d=6u=6(2\\text{cm})=12\\text{cm}d=6u=6(2\\text{cm})=12\\text{cm}$\n\n, as shown in\n\nFigure 2.4\n\n. Notice that here, to avoid confusion, we used\n\n$D=6\\text{km}D=6\\text{km}$\n\nto denote the magnitude of the actual displacement and\n\nd\n\n= 12 cm to denote the length of its representation in the drawing.\n\nFigure\n\n2.3\n\nThe displacement vector from point\n\nA\n\n(the initial position at the campsite) to point\n\nB\n\n(the final position at the fishing hole) is indicated by an arrow with origin at point\n\nA\n\nand end at point\n\nB\n\n. The displacement is the same for any of the actual paths (dashed curves) that may be taken between points\n\nA\n\nand\n\nB\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n2.4\n\nA displacement\n\n$DâDâ$\n\nof magnitude 6 km is drawn to scale as a vector of length 12 cm when the length of 2 cm represents 1 unit of displacement (which in this case is 1 km).\n\nSuppose your friend walks from the campsite at\n\nA\n\nto the fishing pond at\n\nB\n\nand then walks back: from the fishing pond at\n\nB\n\nto the campsite at\n\nA\n\n. The magnitude of the displacement vector\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}{Dâ}_{AB}$\n\nfrom\n\nA\n\nto\n\nB\n\nis the same as the magnitude of the displacement vector\n\n${Dâ}_{BA}{Dâ}_{BA}$\n\nfrom\n\nB\n\nto\n\nA\n\n(it equals 6 km in both cases), so we can write\n\n${D}_{AB}={D}_{BA}{D}_{AB}={D}_{BA}$\n\n. However, vector\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}{Dâ}_{AB}$\n\nis\n\nnot\n\nequal to vector\n\n${Dâ}_{BA}{Dâ}_{BA}$\n\nbecause these two vectors have different directions:\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}â{Dâ}_{BA}{Dâ}_{AB}â{Dâ}_{BA}$\n\n. In\n\nFigure 2.3\n\n, vector\n\n${Dâ}_{BA}{Dâ}_{BA}$\n\nwould be represented by a vector with an origin at point\n\nB\n\nand an end at point\n\nA\n\n, indicating vector\n\n${Dâ}_{BA}{Dâ}_{BA}$\n\npoints to the southwest, which is exactly\n\n$180\\text{Â°}180\\text{Â°}$\n\nopposite to the direction of vector\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}{Dâ}_{AB}$\n\n. We say that vector\n\n${Dâ}_{BA}{Dâ}_{BA}$\n\nis\n\nantiparallel\n\nto vector\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}{Dâ}_{AB}$\n\nand write\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}=\\text{â}{Dâ}_{BA}{Dâ}_{AB}=\\text{â}{Dâ}_{BA}$\n\n, where the minus sign indicates the antiparallel direction.\n\nTwo vectors that have identical directions are said to be\n\nparallel vectors\n\nâmeaning, they are\n\nparallel\n\nto each other. Two parallel vectors\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nand\n\n$BâBâ$\n\nare equal, denoted by\n\n$Aâ=BâAâ=Bâ$\n\n, if and only if they have equal magnitudes\n\n$|Aâ|=|Bâ||Aâ|=|Bâ|$\n\n. Two vectors with directions perpendicular to each other are said to be\n\northogonal vectors\n\n. These relations between vectors are illustrated in\n\nFigure 2.5\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n2.5\n\nVarious relations between two vectors\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nand\n\n$BâBâ$\n\n. (a)\n\n$AââBâAââBâ$\n\nbecause\n\n$AâBAâB$\n\n. (b)\n\n$AââBâAââBâ$\n\nbecause they are not parallel and\n\n$AâBAâB$\n\n. (c)\n\n$Aââ\\text{â}AâAââ\\text{â}Aâ$\n\nbecause they have different directions (even though\n\n$|Aâ|=|âAâ|=A)|Aâ|=|âAâ|=A)$\n\n. (d)\n\n$Aâ=BâAâ=Bâ$\n\nbecause they are parallel\n\nand\n\nhave identical magnitudes\n\nA\n\n=\n\nB.\n\n(e)\n\n$AââBâAââBâ$\n\nbecause they have different directions (are not parallel); here, their directions differ by\n\n$90\\text{Â°}90\\text{Â°}$\n\nâmeaning, they are orthogonal.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n2.1\n\nTwo motorboats named\n\nAlice\n\nand\n\nBob\n\nare moving on a lake. Given the information about their velocity vectors in each of the following situations, indicate whether their velocity vectors are equal or otherwise. (a)\n\nAlice\n\nmoves north at 6 knots and\n\nBob\n\nmoves west at 6 knots. (b)\n\nAlice\n\nmoves west at 6 knots and\n\nBob\n\nmoves west at 3 knots. (c)\n\nAlice\n\nmoves northeast at 6 knots and\n\nBob\n\nmoves south at 3 knots. (d)\n\nAlice\n\nmoves northeast at 6 knots and\n\nBob\n\nmoves southwest at 6 knots. (e)\n\nAlice\n\nmoves northeast at 2 knots and\n\nBob\n\nmoves closer to the shore northeast at 2 knots.\n\nAlgebra of Vectors in One Dimension\n\nVectors can be multiplied by scalars, added to other vectors, or subtracted from other vectors. We can illustrate these vector concepts using an example of the fishing trip seen in\n\nFigure 2.6\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n2.6\n\nDisplacement vectors for a fishing trip. (a) Stopping to rest at point\n\nC\n\nwhile walking from camp (point\n\nA\n\n) to the pond (point\n\nB\n\n). (b) Going back for the dropped tackle box (point\n\nD\n\n). (c) Finishing up at the fishing pond.\n\nSuppose your friend departs from point\n\nA\n\n(the campsite) and walks in the direction to point\n\nB\n\n(the fishing pond), but, along the way, stops to rest at some point\n\nC\n\nlocated three-quarters of the distance between\n\nA\n\nand\n\nB\n\n, beginning from point\n\nA\n\n(\n\nFigure 2.6\n\n(a)). What is his displacement vector\n\n${Dâ}_{AC}{Dâ}_{AC}$\n\nwhen he reaches point\n\nC\n\n? We know that if he walks all the way to\n\nB\n\n, his displacement vector relative to\n\nA\n\nis\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}{Dâ}_{AB}$\n\n, which has magnitude\n\n${D}_{AB}=6\\text{km}{D}_{AB}=6\\text{km}$\n\nand a direction of northeast. If he walks only a 0.75 fraction of the total distance, maintaining the northeasterly direction, at point\n\nC\n\nhe must be\n\n$0.75{D}_{AB}=4.5\\text{km}0.75{D}_{AB}=4.5\\text{km}$\n\naway from the campsite at\n\nA\n\n. So, his displacement vector at the rest point\n\nC\n\nhas magnitude\n\n${D}_{AC}=4.5\\text{km}=0.75{D}_{AB}{D}_{AC}=4.5\\text{km}=0.75{D}_{AB}$\n\nand is parallel to the displacement vector\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}{Dâ}_{AB}$\n\n. All of this can be stated succinctly in the form of the following\n\nvector equation\n\n:\n\n${Dâ}_{AC}=0.75{Dâ}_{AB}.{Dâ}_{AC}=0.75{Dâ}_{AB}.$\n\nIn a vector equation, both sides of the equation are vectors. The previous equation is an example of a vector multiplied by a positive scalar (number)\n\n$Î±=0.75Î±=0.75$\n\n. The result,\n\n${Dâ}_{AC}{Dâ}_{AC}$\n\n, of such a multiplication is a new vector with a direction parallel to the direction of the original vector\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}{Dâ}_{AB}$\n\n.\n\nIn general, when a vector\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nis multiplied by a\n\npositive\n\nscalar\n\n$Î±Î±$\n\n, the result is a new vector\n\n$BâBâ$\n\nthat is\n\nparallel\n\nto\n\n$AâAâ$\n\n:\n\n$Bâ=Î±Aâ.Bâ=Î±Aâ.$\n\n2.1\n\nThe magnitude\n\n$|Bâ||Bâ|$\n\nof this new vector is obtained by multiplying the magnitude\n\n$|Aâ||Aâ|$\n\nof the original vector, as expressed by the\n\nscalar equation\n\n:\n\n$B=|Î±|A.B=|Î±|A.$\n\n2.2\n\nIn a scalar equation, both sides of the equation are numbers.\n\nEquation 2.2\n\nis a scalar equation because the magnitudes of vectors are scalar quantities (and positive numbers). If the scalar\n\n$Î±Î±$\n\nis\n\nnegative\n\nin the vector equation\n\nEquation 2.1\n\n, then the magnitude\n\n$|Bâ||Bâ|$\n\nof the new vector is still given by\n\nEquation 2.2\n\n, but the direction of the new vector\n\n$BâBâ$\n\nis\n\nantiparallel\n\nto the direction of\n\n$AâAâ$\n\n. These principles are illustrated in\n\nFigure 2.7\n\n(a) by two examples where the length of vector\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nis 1.5 units. When\n\n$Î±=2Î±=2$\n\n, the new vector\n\n$Bâ=2AâBâ=2Aâ$\n\nhas length\n\n$B=2A=3.0\\text{units}B=2A=3.0\\text{units}$\n\n(twice as long as the original vector) and is parallel to the original vector. When\n\n$Î±=â2Î±=â2$\n\n, the new vector\n\n$Câ=â2AâCâ=â2Aâ$\n\nhas length\n\n$C=|â2|A=3.0\\text{units}C=|â2|A=3.0\\text{units}$\n\n(twice as long as the original vector) and is antiparallel to the original vector.\n\nFigure\n\n2.7\n\nAlgebra of vectors in one dimension. (a) Multiplication by a scalar. (b) Addition of two vectors\n\n$(Râ(Râ$\n\nis called the\n\nresultant\n\nof vectors\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nand\n\n$Bâ)Bâ)$\n\n. (c) Subtraction of two vectors\n\n$(Dâ(Dâ$\n\nis the difference of vectors\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nand\n\n$Bâ)Bâ)$\n\n.\n\nNow suppose your fishing buddy departs from point\n\nA\n\n(the campsite), walking in the direction to point\n\nB\n\n(the fishing hole), but he realizes he lost his tackle box when he stopped to rest at point\n\nC\n\n(located three-quarters of the distance between\n\nA\n\nand\n\nB\n\n, beginning from point\n\nA\n\n). So, he turns back and retraces his steps in the direction toward the campsite and finds the box lying on the path at some point\n\nD\n\nonly 1.2 km away from point\n\nC\n\n(see\n\nFigure 2.6\n\n(b)). What is his displacement vector\n\n${Dâ}_{AD}{Dâ}_{AD}$\n\nwhen he finds the box at point\n\nD\n\n? What is his displacement vector\n\n${Dâ}_{DB}{Dâ}_{DB}$\n\nfrom point\n\nD\n\nto the hole? We have already established that at rest point\n\nC\n\nhis displacement vector is\n\n${Dâ}_{AC}=0.75{Dâ}_{AB}{Dâ}_{AC}=0.75{Dâ}_{AB}$\n\n. Starting at point\n\nC\n\n, he walks southwest (toward the campsite), which means his new displacement vector\n\n${Dâ}_{CD}{Dâ}_{CD}$\n\nfrom point\n\nC\n\nto point\n\nD\n\nis antiparallel to\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}{Dâ}_{AB}$\n\n.

This means his displacement vector\n\n${Dâ}_{DB}{Dâ}_{DB}$\n\nis the\n\ndifference of two vectors\n\n:\n\n${Dâ}_{DB}={Dâ}_{AB}â{Dâ}_{AD}={Dâ}_{AB}+(\\text{â}{Dâ}_{AD}).{Dâ}_{DB}={Dâ}_{AB}â{Dâ}_{AD}={Dâ}_{AB}+(\\text{â}{Dâ}_{AD}).$\n\n2.5\n\nNotice that a difference of two vectors is nothing more than a vector sum of two vectors because the second term in\n\nEquation 2.5\n\nis vector\n\n$\\text{â}{Dâ}_{AD}\\text{â}{Dâ}_{AD}$\n\n(which is antiparallel to\n\n${Dâ}_{AD}){Dâ}_{AD})$\n\n. When we substitute\n\nEquation 2.4\n\ninto\n\nEquation 2.5\n\n, we obtain the second displacement vector:\n\n${Dâ}_{DB}={Dâ}_{AB}â{Dâ}_{AD}={Dâ}_{AB}â0.55{Dâ}_{AB}=(1.0â0.55){Dâ}_{AB}=0.45{Dâ}_{AB}.{Dâ}_{DB}={Dâ}_{AB}â{Dâ}_{AD}={Dâ}_{AB}â0.55{Dâ}_{AB}=(1.0â0.55){Dâ}_{AB}=0.45{Dâ}_{AB}.$\n\n2.6\n\nThis result means your friend walked\n\n${D}_{DB}=0.45{D}_{AB}=0.45(6.0\\text{km})=2.7\\text{km}{D}_{DB}=0.45{D}_{AB}=0.45(6.0\\text{km})=2.7\\text{km}$\n\nfrom the point where he finds his tackle box to the fishing hole.\n\nWhen vectors\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nand\n\n$BâBâ$\n\nlie along a line (that is, in one dimension), such as in the camping example, their resultant\n\n$Râ=Aâ+BâRâ=Aâ+Bâ$\n\nand their difference\n\n$Dâ=AââBâDâ=AââBâ$\n\nboth lie along the same direction. We can illustrate the addition or subtraction of vectors by drawing the corresponding vectors to scale in one dimension, as shown in\n\nFigure 2.7\n\n.\n\nTo illustrate the resultant when\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nand\n\n$BâBâ$\n\nare two parallel vectors, we draw them along one line by placing the origin of one vector at the end of the other vector in head-to-tail fashion (see\n\nFigure 2.7\n\n(b)). The magnitude of this resultant is the sum of their magnitudes:\n\nR\n\n=\n\nA\n\n+\n\nB\n\n. The direction of the resultant is parallel to both vectors. When vector\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nis antiparallel to vector\n\n$BâBâ$\n\n, we draw them along one line in either head-to-head fashion (\n\nFigure 2.7\n\n(c)) or tail-to-tail fashion. The magnitude of the vector difference, then, is the\n\nabsolute value\n\n$D=|AâB|D=|AâB|$\n\nof the difference of their magnitudes. The direction of the difference vector\n\n$DâDâ$\n\nis parallel to the direction of the longer vector.\n\nIn general, in one dimensionâas well as in higher dimensions, such as in a plane or in spaceâwe can add any number of vectors and we can do so in any order because the addition of vectors is\n\ncommutative\n\n,\n\n$Aâ+Bâ=Bâ+Aâ,Aâ+Bâ=Bâ+Aâ,$\n\n2.7\n\nand\n\nassociative\n\n,\n\n$(Aâ+Bâ)+Câ=Aâ+(Bâ+Câ).(Aâ+Bâ)+Câ=Aâ+(Bâ+Câ).$\n\n2.8\n\nMoreover, multiplication by a scalar is\n\ndistributive\n\n:\n\n${Î±}_{1}Aâ+{Î±}_{2}Aâ=({Î±}_{1}+{Î±}_{2})Aâ.{Î±}_{1}Aâ+{Î±}_{2}Aâ=({Î±}_{1}+{Î±}_{2})Aâ.$\n\n2.9\n\nWe used the distributive property in\n\nEquation 2.4\n\nand\n\nEquation 2.6\n\n.\n\nWhen adding many vectors in one dimension, it is convenient to use the concept of a\n\nunit vector\n\n. A unit vector, which is denoted by a letter symbol with a hat, such as\n\n$u^u^$\n\n, has a magnitude of one and does not have any physical unit so that\n\n$|u^|â¡u=1|u^|â¡u=1$\n\n. The only role of a unit vector is to specify direction. For example, instead of saying vector\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}{Dâ}_{AB}$\n\nhas a magnitude of 6.0 km and a direction of northeast, we can introduce a unit vector\n\n$u^u^$\n\nthat points to the northeast and say succinctly that\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}=(6.0\\text{km})u^{Dâ}_{AB}=(6.0\\text{km})u^$\n\n. Then the southwesterly direction is simply given by the unit vector\n\n$\\text{â}u^\\text{â}u^$\n\n. In this way, the displacement of 6.0 km in the southwesterly direction is expressed by the vector\n\n${Dâ}_{BA}=(â6.0\\text{km})u^.{Dâ}_{BA}=(â6.0\\text{km})u^.$\n\nExample\n\n2.1\n\nA Ladybug Walker\n\nA long measuring stick rests against a wall in a physics laboratory with its 200-cm end at the floor. A ladybug lands on the 100-cm mark and crawls randomly along the stick. It first walks 15 cm toward the floor, then it walks 56 cm toward the wall, then it walks 3 cm toward the floor again. Then, after a brief stop, it continues for 25 cm toward the floor and then, again, it crawls up 19 cm toward the wall before coming to a complete rest (\n\nFigure 2.8\n\n). Find the vector of its total displacement and its final resting position on the stick.\n\nStrategy\n\nIf we choose the direction along the stick toward the floor as the direction of unit vector\n\n$u^u^$\n\n, then the direction toward the floor is\n\n$+u^+u^$\n\nand the direction toward the wall is\n\n$\\text{â}u^\\text{â}u^$\n\n. The ladybug makes a total of five displacements:\n\n${Dâ}_{1}=(15\\text{cm})(+u^),{Dâ}_{2}=(56\\text{cm})(\\text{â}u^),{Dâ}_{3}=(3\\text{cm})(+u^),{Dâ}_{4}=(25\\text{cm})(+u^),\\text{and}{Dâ}_{5}=(19\\text{cm})(\\text{â}u^).{Dâ}_{1}=(15\\text{cm})(+u^),{Dâ}_{2}=(56\\text{cm})(\\text{â}u^),{Dâ}_{3}=(3\\text{cm})(+u^),{Dâ}_{4}=(25\\text{cm})(+u^),\\text{and}{Dâ}_{5}=(19\\text{cm})(\\text{â}u^).$\n\nThe total displacement\n\n$DâDâ$\n\nis the resultant of all its displacement vectors.\n\nFigure\n\n2.8\n\nFive displacements of the ladybug. Note that in this schematic drawing, magnitudes of displacements are not drawn to scale. (credit \"ladybug\": modification of work by âPersian Poet Galâ/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nSolution\n\nThe resultant of all the displacement vectors is\n\n$Dâ={Dâ}_{1}+{Dâ}_{2}+{Dâ}_{3}+{Dâ}_{4}+{Dâ}_{5}=(15\\text{cm})(+u^)+(56\\text{cm})(\\text{â}u^)+(3\\text{cm})(+u^)+(25\\text{cm})(+u^)+(19\\text{cm})(\\text{â}u^)=(15â56+3+25â19)\\text{cm}u^=â32\\text{cm}u^.Dâ={Dâ}_{1}+{Dâ}_{2}+{Dâ}_{3}+{Dâ}_{4}+{Dâ}_{5}=(15\\text{cm})(+u^)+(56\\text{cm})(\\text{â}u^)+(3\\text{cm})(+u^)+(25\\text{cm})(+u^)+(19\\text{cm})(\\text{â}u^)=(15â56+3+25â19)\\text{cm}u^=â32\\text{cm}u^.$\n\nIn this calculation, we use the distributive law given by\n\nEquation 2.9\n\n. The result reads that the total displacement vector points away from the 100-cm mark (initial landing site) toward the end of the meter stick that touches the wall. The end that touches the wall is marked 0 cm, so the final position of the ladybug is at the (100 â 32)cm = 68-cm mark.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n2.2\n\nA cave diver enters a long underwater tunnel. When her displacement with respect to the entry point is 20 m, she accidentally drops her camera, but she doesnât notice it missing until she is some 6 m farther into the tunnel. She swims back 10 m but cannot find the camera, so she decides to end the dive. How far from the entry point is she? Taking the positive direction out of the tunnel, what is her displacement vector relative to the entry point?\n\nAlgebra of Vectors in Two Dimensions\n\nWhen vectors lie in a planeâthat is, when they are in two dimensionsâthey can be multiplied by scalars, added to other vectors, or subtracted from other vectors in accordance with the general laws expressed by\n\nEquation 2.1\n\n,\n\nEquation 2.2\n\n,\n\nEquation 2.7\n\n, and\n\nEquation 2.8\n\n. However, the addition rule for two vectors in a plane becomes more complicated than the rule for vector addition in one dimension. We have to use the laws of geometry to construct resultant vectors, followed by trigonometry to find vector magnitudes and directions. This geometric approach is commonly used in navigation (\n\nFigure 2.9\n\n). In this section, we need to have at hand two rulers, a triangle, a protractor, a pencil, and an eraser for drawing vectors to scale by geometric constructions.\n\nFigure\n\n2.9\n\nIn navigation, the laws of geometry are used to draw resultant displacements on nautical maps.\n\nFor a geometric construction of the sum of two vectors in a plane, we follow\n\nthe parallelogram rule\n\n. Suppose two vectors\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nand\n\n$BâBâ$\n\nare at the arbitrary positions shown in\n\nFigure 2.10\n\n. Translate either one of them in parallel to the beginning of the other vector, so that after the translation, both vectors have their origins at the same point. Now, at the end of vector\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nwe draw a line parallel to vector\n\n$BâBâ$\n\nand at the end of vector\n\n$BâBâ$\n\nwe draw a line parallel to vector\n\n$AâAâ$\n\n(the dashed lines in\n\nFigure 2.10\n\n). In this way, we obtain a parallelogram. From the origin of the two vectors we draw a diagonal that is the resultant\n\n$RâRâ$\n\nof the two vectors:\n\n$Râ=Aâ+BâRâ=Aâ+Bâ$\n\n(\n\nFigure 2.10\n\n(a)). The other diagonal of this parallelogram is the vector difference of the two vectors\n\n$Dâ=AââBâDâ=AââBâ$\n\n, as shown in\n\nFigure 2.10\n\n(b). Notice that the end of the difference vector is placed at the end of vector\n\n$AâAâ$\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n2.10\n\nThe parallelogram rule for the addition of two vectors. Make the parallel translation of each vector to a point where their origins (marked by the dot) coincide and construct a parallelogram with two sides on the vectors and the other two sides (indicated by dashed lines) parallel to the vectors. (a) Draw the resultant vector\n\n$RâRâ$\n\nalong the diagonal of the parallelogram from the common point to the opposite corner. Length\n\nR\n\nof the resultant vector is\n\nnot\n\nequal to the sum of the magnitudes of the two vectors. (b) Draw the difference vector\n\n$Dâ=AââBâDâ=AââBâ$\n\nalong the diagonal connecting the ends of the vectors. Place the origin of vector\n\n$DâDâ$\n\nat the end of vector\n\n$BâBâ$\n\nand the end (arrowhead) of vector\n\n$DâDâ$\n\nat the end of vector\n\n$AâAâ$\n\n. Length\n\nD\n\nof the difference vector is\n\nnot\n\nequal to the difference of magnitudes of the two vectors.\n\nIt follows from the parallelogram rule that neither the magnitude of the resultant vector nor the magnitude of the difference vector can be expressed as a simple sum or difference of magnitudes\n\nA\n\nand\n\nB\n\n, because the length of a diagonal cannot be expressed as a simple sum of side lengths. When using a geometric construction to find magnitudes\n\n$|Râ||Râ|$\n\nand\n\n$|Dâ||Dâ|$\n\n, we have to use trigonometry laws for triangles, which may lead to complicated algebra. There are two ways to circumvent this algebraic complexity. One way is to use the method of components, which we examine in the next section. The other way is to draw the vectors to scale, as is done in navigation, and read approximate vector lengths and angles (directions) from the graphs. In this section we examine the second approach.\n\nIf we need to add three or more vectors, we repeat the parallelogram rule for the pairs of vectors until we find the resultant of all of the resultants. For three vectors, for example, we first find the resultant of vector 1 and vector 2, and then we find the resultant of this resultant and vector 3. The order in which we select the pairs of vectors does not matter because the operation of vector addition is commutative and associative (see\n\nEquation 2.7\n\nand\n\nEquation 2.8\n\n). Before we state a general rule that follows from repetitive applications of the parallelogram rule, letâs look at the following example.\n\nSuppose you plan a vacation trip in Florida. Departing from Tallahassee, the state capital, you plan to visit your uncle Joe in Jacksonville, see your cousin Vinny in Daytona Beach, stop for a little fun in Orlando, see a circus performance in Tampa, and visit the University of Florida in Gainesville. Your route may be represented by five displacement vectors\n\n$Aâ,Aâ,$\n\n$BâBâ$\n\n,\n\n$CâCâ$\n\n,\n\n$DâDâ$\n\n, and\n\n$EâEâ$\n\n, which are indicated by the red vectors in\n\nFigure 2.11\n\n. What is your total displacement when you reach Gainesville? The total displacement is the vector sum of all five displacement vectors, which may be found by using the parallelogram rule four times. Alternatively, recall that the displacement vector has its beginning at the initial position (Tallahassee) and its end at the final position (Gainesville), so the total displacement vector can be drawn directly as an arrow connecting Tallahassee with Gainesville (see the green vector in\n\nFigure 2.11\n\n). When we use the parallelogram rule four times, the resultant\n\n$RâRâ$\n\nwe obtain is exactly this green vector connecting Tallahassee with Gainesville:\n\n$Râ=Aâ+Bâ+Câ+Dâ+EâRâ=Aâ+Bâ+Câ+Dâ+Eâ$\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n2.11\n\nWhen we use the parallelogram rule four times, we obtain the resultant vector\n\n$Râ=Aâ+Bâ+Câ+Dâ+EâRâ=Aâ+Bâ+Câ+Dâ+Eâ$\n\n, which is the green vector connecting Tallahassee with Gainesville.\n\nDrawing the resultant vector of many vectors can be generalized by using the following\n\ntail-to-head geometric construction\n\n. Suppose we want to draw the resultant vector\n\n$RâRâ$\n\nof four vectors\n\n$AâAâ$\n\n,\n\n$BâBâ$\n\n,\n\n$CâCâ$\n\n, and\n\n$DâDâ$\n\n(\n\nFigure 2.12\n\n(a)). We select any one of the vectors as the first vector and make a parallel translation of a second vector to a position where the origin (âtailâ) of the second vector coincides with the end (âheadâ) of the first vector. Then, we select a third vector and make a parallel translation of the third vector to a position where the origin of the third vector coincides with the end of the second vector. We repeat this procedure until all the vectors are in a head-to-tail arrangement like the one shown in\n\nFigure 2.12\n\n. We draw the resultant vector\n\n$RâRâ$\n\nby connecting the origin (âtailâ) of the first vector with the end (âheadâ) of the last vector. The end of the resultant vector is at the end of the last vector. Because the addition of vectors is associative and commutative, we obtain the same resultant vector regardless of which vector we choose to be first, second, third, or fourth in this construction.\n\nFigure\n\n2.12\n\nTail-to-head method for drawing the resultant vector\n\n$Râ=Aâ+Bâ+Câ+DâRâ=Aâ+Bâ+Câ+Dâ$\n\n. (a) Four vectors of different magnitudes and directions. (b) Vectors in (a) are translated to new positions where the origin (âtailâ) of one vector is at the end (âheadâ) of another vector. The resultant vector is drawn from the origin (âtailâ) of the first vector to the end (âheadâ) of the last vector in this arrangement.\n\nExample\n\n2.2\n\nGeometric Construction of the Resultant\n\nThe three displacement vectors\n\n$AâAâ$\n\n,\n\n$BâBâ$\n\n, and\n\n$CâCâ$\n\nin\n\nFigure 2.13\n\nare specified by their magnitudes\n\nA\n\n= 10.0,\n\nB\n\n= 7.0, and\n\nC\n\n= 8.0, respectively, and by their respective direction angles with the horizontal direction\n\n$Î±=35\\text{Â°}Î±=35\\text{Â°}$\n\n,\n\n$Î²=â110\\text{Â°}Î²=â110\\text{Â°}$\n\n, and\n\n$Î³=30\\text{Â°}Î³=30\\text{Â°}$\n\n. The physical units of the magnitudes are centimeters. Choose a convenient scale and use a ruler and a protractor to find the following vector sums: (a)\n\n$Râ=Aâ+BâRâ=Aâ+Bâ$\n\n, (b)\n\n$Dâ=AââBâ\\text{, and}Dâ=AââBâ\\text{, and}$\n\n(c)\n\n$Sâ=Aââ3Bâ+CâSâ=Aââ3Bâ+Câ$\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n2.13\n\nVectors used in\n\nExample 2.2\n\nand in the Check Your Understanding feature that follows.\n\nStrategy\n\nIn geometric construction, to find a vector means to find its magnitude and its direction angle with the horizontal direction. The strategy is to draw to scale the vectors that appear on the right-hand side of the equation and construct the resultant vector. Then, use a ruler and a protractor to read the magnitude of the resultant and the direction angle. For parts (a) and (b) we use the parallelogram rule. For (c) we use the tail-to-head method.\n\nSolution\n\nFor parts (a) and (b), we attach the origin of vector\n\n$BâBâ$\n\nto the origin of vector\n\n$AâAâ$\n\n, as shown in\n\nFigure 2.14\n\n, and construct a parallelogram. The shorter diagonal of this parallelogram is the sum\n\n$Aâ+BâAâ+Bâ$\n\n. The longer of the diagonals is the difference\n\n$AââBâAââBâ$\n\n. We use a ruler to measure the lengths of the diagonals, and a protractor to measure the angles with the horizontal. For the resultant\n\n$RâRâ$\n\n, we obtain\n\nR\n\n= 5.8 cm and\n\n${Î¸}_{R}â0\\text{Â°}{Î¸}_{R}â0\\text{Â°}$\n\n. For the difference\n\n$DâDâ$\n\n, we obtain\n\nD\n\n= 16.2 cm and\n\n${Î¸}_{D}=49.3\\text{Â°}{Î¸}_{D}=49.3\\text{Â°}$\n\n, which are shown in\n\nFigure 2.14\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n2.14\n\nUsing the parallelogram rule to solve (a) (finding the resultant, red) and (b) (finding the difference, blue).\n\nFor (c), we can start with vector\n\n$â3Bââ3Bâ$\n\nand draw the remaining vectors tail-to-head as shown in\n\nFigure 2.15\n\n. In vector addition, the order in which we draw the vectors is unimportant, but drawing the vectors to scale is very important. Next, we draw vector\n\n$SâSâ$\n\nfrom the origin of the first vector to the end of the last vector and place the arrowhead at the end of\n\n$SâSâ$\n\n. We use a ruler to measure the length of\n\n$SâSâ$\n\n, and find that its magnitude is\n\nS\n\n= 36.9 cm. We use a protractor and find that its direction angle is\n\n${Î¸}_{S}=52.9\\text{Â°}{Î¸}_{S}=52.9\\text{Â°}$\n\n. This solution is shown in\n\nFigure 2.15\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n2.15\n\nUsing the tail-to-head method to solve (c) (finding vector\n\n$SâSâ$\n\n, green).\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n2.3\n\nUsing the three displacement vectors\n\n$AâAâ$\n\n,\n\n$BâBâ$\n\n, and\n\n$FâFâ$\n\nin\n\nFigure 2.13\n\n, choose a convenient scale, and use a ruler and a protractor to find vector\n\n$GâGâ$\n\ngiven by the vector equation\n\n$Gâ=Aâ+2BââFâGâ=Aâ+2BââFâ$\n\n.\n\nInteractive\n\nObserve the addition of vectors in a plane by visiting this\n\nvector calculator\n\n, and by engaging the Phet simulation below.\n\nAccess multimedia content"

Even in everyday life we naturally invoke the concept of vector components in a rectangular coordinate system.

The\n\nx\n\n-coordinate of vector\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nis called its\n\nx\n\n-component and the\n\ny\n\n-coordinate of vector\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nis called its\n\ny\n\n-component. The vector\n\nx\n\n-component is a vector denoted by\n\n${Aâ}_{x}{Aâ}_{x}$\n\n. The vector\n\ny\n\n-component is a vector denoted by\n\n${Aâ}_{y}{Aâ}_{y}$\n\n.

If you move the pointer to an icon located at point (2.0 cm, 4.5 cm), what is the displacement vector of the pointer?\n\nStrategy\n\nThe origin of the\n\nxy\n\n-coordinate system is the lower left-side corner of the computer monitor. Therefore, the unit vector\n\n$i^i^$\n\non the\n\nx\n\n-axis points horizontally to the right and the unit vector\n\n$j^j^$\n\non the\n\ny\n\n-axis points vertically upward. The origin of the displacement vector is located at point b(6.0, 1.6) and the end of the displacement vector is located at point e(2.0, 4.5). Substitute the coordinates of these points into\n\nEquation 2.13\n\nto find the scalar components\n\n${D}_{x}{D}_{x}$\n\nand\n\n${D}_{y}{D}_{y}$\n\nof the displacement vector\n\n$DâDâ$\n\n. Finally, substitute the coordinates into\n\nEquation 2.12\n\nto write the displacement vector in the vector component form.\n\nSolution\n\nWe identify\n\n${x}_{b}=6.0{x}_{b}=6.0$\n\n,\n\n${x}_{e}=2.0{x}_{e}=2.0$\n\n,\n\n${y}_{b}=1.6{y}_{b}=1.6$\n\n, and\n\n${y}_{e}=4.5{y}_{e}=4.5$\n\n, where the physical unit is 1 cm.

Often, the latter way is more convenient because it is simpler.\n\nThe vector\n\nx\n\n-component\n\n${Dâ}_{x}=â4.0i^=4.0(\\text{â}i^){Dâ}_{x}=â4.0i^=4.0(\\text{â}i^)$\n\nof the displacement vector has the magnitude\n\n$|{Dâ}_{x}|=|â4.0||i^|=4.0|{Dâ}_{x}|=|â4.0||i^|=4.0$\n\nbecause the magnitude of the unit vector is\n\n$|i^|=1|i^|=1$\n\n. Notice, too, that the direction of the\n\nx\n\n-component is\n\n$\\text{â}i^\\text{â}i^$\n\n, which is antiparallel to the direction of the +\n\nx\n\n-axis; hence, the\n\nx\n\n-component vector\n\n${Dâ}_{x}{Dâ}_{x}$\n\npoints to the left, as shown in\n\nFigure 2.17\n\n. The scalar\n\nx\n\n-component of vector\n\n$DâDâ$\n\nis\n\n${D}_{x}=â4.0{D}_{x}=â4.0$\n\n.\n\nSimilarly, the vector\n\ny\n\n-component\n\n${Dâ}_{y}=+2.9j^{Dâ}_{y}=+2.9j^$\n\nof the displacement vector has magnitude\n\n$|{Dâ}_{y}|=|2.9||j^|=2.9|{Dâ}_{y}|=|2.9||j^|=2.9$\n\nbecause the magnitude of the unit vector is\n\n$|j^|=1|j^|=1$\n\n. The direction of the\n\ny\n\n-component is\n\n$+j^+j^$\n\n, which is parallel to the direction of the +\n\ny\n\n-axis. Therefore, the\n\ny\n\n-component vector\n\n${Dâ}_{y}{Dâ}_{y}$\n\npoints up, as seen in\n\nFigure 2.17\n\n.

For example, imagine 400 cars moving on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco in a strong wind. Each car gives the bridge a different push in various directions and we would like to know how big the resultant push can possibly be. We have already gained some experience with the geometric construction of vector sums, so we know the task of finding the resultant by drawing the vectors and measuring their lengths and angles may become intractable pretty quickly, leading to huge errors. Worries like this do not appear when we use analytical methods. The very first step in an analytical approach is to find vector components when the direction and magnitude of a vector are known.\n\nLet us return to the right triangle in\n\nFigure 2.18\n\n.

Trooper wanders a lot and makes many trial sniffs along many different paths. Trooper eventually finds the child and the story has a happy ending, but his displacements on various legs seem to be truly convoluted. On one of the legs he walks 200.0 m southeast, then he runs north some 300.0 m. On the third leg, he examines the scents carefully for 50.0 m in the direction\n\n$30\\text{Â°}30\\text{Â°}$\n\nwest of north. On the fourth leg, Trooper goes directly south for 80.0 m, picks up a fresh scent and turns\n\n$23\\text{Â°}23\\text{Â°}$\n\nwest of south for 150.0 m. Find the scalar components of Trooperâs displacement vectors and his displacement vectors in vector component form for each leg.\n\nStrategy\n\nLetâs adopt a rectangular coordinate system with the positive\n\nx\n\n-axis in the direction of geographic east, with the positive\n\ny\n\n-direction pointed to geographic north. Explicitly, the unit vector\n\n$i^i^$\n\nof the\n\nx\n\n-axis points east and the unit vector\n\n$j^j^$\n\nof the\n\ny\n\n-axis points north. Trooper makes five legs, so there are five displacement vectors. We start by identifying their magnitudes and direction angles, then we use\n\nEquation 2.17\n\nto find the scalar components of the displacements and\n\nEquation 2.12\n\nfor the displacement vectors.\n\nSolution\n\nOn the first leg, the displacement magnitude is\n\n${L}_{1}=200.0\\text{m}{L}_{1}=200.0\\text{m}$\n\nand the direction is southeast.

The direction angle is\n\n${Î¸}_{2}=+90\\text{Â°}{Î¸}_{2}=+90\\text{Â°}$\n\n. We obtain the following results:\n\n${L}_{2x}={L}_{2}\\text{cos}{Î¸}_{2}=(300.0\\text{m})\\text{cos}90\\text{Â°}=0.0,{L}_{2y}={L}_{2}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{2}=(300.0\\text{m})\\text{sin}90\\text{Â°}=300.0\\text{m,}{Lâ}_{2}={L}_{2x}i^+{L}_{2y}j^=(300.0\\text{m})j^.{L}_{2x}={L}_{2}\\text{cos}{Î¸}_{2}=(300.0\\text{m})\\text{cos}90\\text{Â°}=0.0,{L}_{2y}={L}_{2}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{2}=(300.0\\text{m})\\text{sin}90\\text{Â°}=300.0\\text{m,}{Lâ}_{2}={L}_{2x}i^+{L}_{2y}j^=(300.0\\text{m})j^.$\n\nOn the third leg, the displacement magnitude is\n\n${L}_{3}=50.0\\text{m}{L}_{3}=50.0\\text{m}$\n\nand the direction is\n\n$30\\text{Â°}30\\text{Â°}$\n\nwest of north.

In the Cartesian coordinate system these directions are given by unit vectors\n\n$i^i^$\n\nand\n\n$j^j^$\n\nalong the\n\nx\n\n-axis and the\n\ny\n\n-axis, respectively. The Cartesian coordinate system is very convenient to use in describing displacements and velocities of objects and the forces acting on them. However, it becomes cumbersome when we need to describe the rotation of objects. When describing rotation, we usually work in the\n\npolar coordinate system\n\n.\n\nIn the polar coordinate system, the location of point\n\nP\n\nin a plane is given by two\n\npolar coordinates\n\n(\n\nFigure 2.20\n\n). The first polar coordinate is the\n\nradial coordinate\n\nr\n\n, which is the distance of point\n\nP\n\nfrom the origin. The second polar coordinate is an angle\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\nthat the radial vector makes with some chosen direction, usually the positive\n\nx\n\n-direction. In polar coordinates, angles are measured in radians, or rads. The radial vector is attached at the origin and points away from the origin to point\n\nP.\n\nThis radial direction is described by a unit radial vector\n\n$r^r^$\n\n. The second unit vector\n\n$t^t^$\n\nis a vector orthogonal to the radial direction\n\n$r^r^$\n\n. The positive\n\n$+t^+t^$\n\ndirection indicates how the angle\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\nchanges in the counterclockwise direction. In this way, a point\n\nP\n\nthat has coordinates (\n\nx\n\n,\n\ny\n\n) in the rectangular system can be described equivalently in the polar coordinate system by the two polar coordinates\n\n$(r,Ï)(r,Ï)$\n\n.\n\nEquation 2.17\n\nis valid for any vector, so we can use it to express the\n\nx\n\n- and\n\ny\n\n-coordinates of vector\n\n$rârâ$\n\n. In this way, we obtain the connection between the polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates of point\n\nP\n\n:\n\n${x=r\\text{cos}Ïy=r\\text{sin}Ï.{x=r\\text{cos}Ïy=r\\text{sin}Ï.$\n\n2.18\n\nFigure\n\n2.20\n\nUsing polar coordinates, the unit vector\n\n$r^r^$\n\ndefines the positive direction along the radius\n\nr\n\n(radial direction) and, orthogonal to it, the unit vector\n\n$t^t^$\n\ndefines the positive direction of rotation by the angle\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\n.\n\nExample\n\n2.6\n\nPolar Coordinates\n\nA treasure hunter finds one silver coin at a location 20.0 m away from a dry well in the direction\n\n$20\\text{Â°}20\\text{Â°}$\n\nnorth of east and finds one gold coin at a location 10.0 m away from the well in the direction\n\n$20\\text{Â°}20\\text{Â°}$\n\nnorth of west. What are the polar and rectangular coordinates of these findings with respect to the well?\n\nStrategy\n\nThe well marks the origin of the coordinate system and east is the +\n\nx\n\n-direction. We identify radial distances from the locations to the origin, which are\n\n${r}_{S}=20.0\\text{m}{r}_{S}=20.0\\text{m}$\n\n(for the silver coin) and\n\n${r}_{G}=10.0\\text{m}{r}_{G}=10.0\\text{m}$\n\n(for the gold coin). To find the angular coordinates, we convert\n\n$20\\text{Â°}20\\text{Â°}$\n\nto radians:\n\n$20\\text{Â°}=Ï20\\text{/}180=Ï\\text{/}920\\text{Â°}=Ï20\\text{/}180=Ï\\text{/}9$\n\n. We use\n\nEquation 2.18\n\nto find the\n\nx\n\n- and\n\ny\n\n-coordinates of the coins.\n\nSolution\n\nThe angular coordinate of the silver coin is\n\n${Ï}_{S}=Ï\\text{/}9{Ï}_{S}=Ï\\text{/}9$\n\n, whereas the angular coordinate of the gold coin is\n\n${Ï}_{G}=ÏâÏ\\text{/}9=8Ï\\text{/}9{Ï}_{G}=ÏâÏ\\text{/}9=8Ï\\text{/}9$\n\n. Hence, the polar coordinates of the silver coin are\n\n$({r}_{S},{Ï}_{S})=(20.0\\text{m},Ï\\text{/}9)({r}_{S},{Ï}_{S})=(20.0\\text{m},Ï\\text{/}9)$\n\nand those of the gold coin are\n\n$({r}_{G},{Ï}_{G})=(10.0\\text{m},8Ï\\text{/}9)({r}_{G},{Ï}_{G})=(10.0\\text{m},8Ï\\text{/}9)$\n\n. We substitute these coordinates into\n\nEquation 2.18\n\nto obtain rectangular coordinates.

Three-dimensional space has three orthogonal directions, so we need not two but\n\nthree\n\nunit vectors to define a three-dimensional coordinate system. In the Cartesian coordinate system, the first two unit vectors are the unit vector of the\n\nx\n\n-axis\n\n$i^i^$\n\nand the unit vector of the\n\ny\n\n-axis\n\n$j^j^$\n\n. The third unit vector\n\n$k^k^$\n\nis the direction of the\n\nz\n\n-axis (\n\nFigure 2.21\n\n). The order in which the axes are labeled, which is the order in which the three unit vectors appear, is important because it defines the orientation of the coordinate system. The order\n\nx\n\n-\n\ny\n\n-\n\nz\n\n, which is equivalent to the order\n\n$i^i^$\n\n-\n\n$j^j^$\n\n-\n\n$k^k^$\n\n, defines the standard right-handed coordinate system (positive orientation). Notice that while previously the\n\ny\n\n-axis was used for the upward direction, in three dimensions we usually choose\n\nz\n\nto represent the vertical. A right-handed coordinate system with\n\nz\n\nup and with one of the remaining axes pointing to the right and the other out of the page must have the\n\ny\n\n-axis pointing right and\n\nx\n\nout of the page, as illustrated here.\n\nFigure\n\n2.21\n\nThree unit vectors define a Cartesian system in three-dimensional space. The order in which these unit vectors appear defines the orientation of the coordinate system. The order shown here defines the right-handed orientation.\n\nIn three-dimensional space, vector\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nhas three vector components: the\n\nx\n\n-component\n\n${Aâ}_{x}={A}_{x}i^{Aâ}_{x}={A}_{x}i^$\n\n, which is the part of vector\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nalong the\n\nx\n\n-axis; the\n\ny\n\n-component\n\n${Aâ}_{y}={A}_{y}j^{Aâ}_{y}={A}_{y}j^$\n\n, which is the part of\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nalong the\n\ny\n\n-axis; and the\n\nz\n\n-component\n\n${Aâ}_{z}={A}_{z}k^{Aâ}_{z}={A}_{z}k^$\n\n, which is the part of the vector along the\n\nz\n\n-axis. A vector in three-dimensional space is the vector sum of its three vector components (\n\nFigure 2.22\n\n):\n\n$Aâ={A}_{x}i^+{A}_{y}j^+{A}_{z}k^.Aâ={A}_{x}i^+{A}_{y}j^+{A}_{z}k^.$\n\n2.19\n\nIf we know the coordinates of its origin\n\n$b({x}_{b},{y}_{b},{z}_{b})b({x}_{b},{y}_{b},{z}_{b})$\n\nand of its end\n\n$e({x}_{e},{y}_{e},{z}_{e})e({x}_{e},{y}_{e},{z}_{e})$\n\n, its scalar components are obtained by taking their differences:\n\n${A}_{x}{A}_{x}$\n\nand\n\n${A}_{y}{A}_{y}$\n\nare given by\n\nEquation 2.13\n\nand the\n\nz\n\n-component is given by\n\n${A}_{z}={z}_{e}â{z}_{b}.{A}_{z}={z}_{e}â{z}_{b}.$\n\n2.20\n\nMagnitude\n\nA\n\nis obtained by generalizing\n\nEquation 2.15\n\nto three dimensions:\n\n$A=\\sqrt{{A}_{x}^{2}+{A}_{y}^{2}+{A}_{z}^{2}}.A=\\sqrt{{A}_{x}^{2}+{A}_{y}^{2}+{A}_{z}^{2}}.$\n\n2.21\n\nThis expression for the vector magnitude comes from applying the Pythagorean theorem twice. As seen in\n\nFigure 2.22\n\n, the diagonal in the\n\nxy\n\n-plane has length\n\n$\\sqrt{{A}_{x}^{2}+{A}_{y}^{2}}\\sqrt{{A}_{x}^{2}+{A}_{y}^{2}}$\n\nand its square adds to the square\n\n${A}_{z}^{2}{A}_{z}^{2}$\n\nto give\n\n${A}^{2}{A}^{2}$\n\n. Note that when the\n\nz\n\n-component is zero, the vector lies entirely in the\n\nxy\n\n-plane and its description is reduced to two dimensions.\n\nFigure\n\n2.22\n\nA vector in three-dimensional space is the vector sum of its three vector components.\n\nExample\n\n2.7\n\nTakeoff of a Drone\n\nDuring a takeoff of IAI Heron (\n\nFigure 2.23\n\n), its position with respect to a control tower is 100 m above the ground, 300 m to the east, and 200 m to the north.

Find their total displacement vector relative to the lodge when they are at the rest point. How far and in what direction must they ski from the rest point to return directly to the lodge?\n\nStrategy\n\nWe assume a rectangular coordinate system with the origin at the ski lodge and with the unit vector\n\n$i^i^$\n\npointing east and the unit vector\n\n$j^j^$\n\npointing north. There are three displacements:\n\n${Dâ}_{1}{Dâ}_{1}$\n\n,\n\n${Dâ}_{2}{Dâ}_{2}$\n\n, and\n\n${Dâ}_{3}{Dâ}_{3}$\n\n. We identify their magnitudes as\n\n${D}_{1}=5.0\\text{km}{D}_{1}=5.0\\text{km}$\n\n,\n\n${D}_{2}=3.0\\text{km}{D}_{2}=3.0\\text{km}$\n\n, and\n\n${D}_{3}=4.0\\text{km}{D}_{3}=4.0\\text{km}$\n\n. We identify their directions are the angles\n\n${Î¸}_{1}=90\\text{Â°}{Î¸}_{1}=90\\text{Â°}$\n\n,\n\n${Î¸}_{2}=180\\text{Â°}{Î¸}_{2}=180\\text{Â°}$\n\n, and\n\n${Î¸}_{3}=180\\text{Â°}+45\\text{Â°}=225\\text{Â°}{Î¸}_{3}=180\\text{Â°}+45\\text{Â°}=225\\text{Â°}$\n\n. We resolve each displacement vector to its scalar components and substitute the components into\n\nEquation 2.25\n\nto obtain the scalar components of the resultant displacement\n\n$DâDâ$\n\nfrom the lodge to the rest point. On the way back from the rest point to the lodge, the displacement is\n\n$Bâ=\\text{â}DâBâ=\\text{â}Dâ$\n\n. Finally, we find the magnitude and direction of\n\n$BâBâ$\n\n.\n\nSolution\n\nScalar components of the displacement vectors are\n\n${{D}_{1x}={D}_{1}\\text{cos}{Î¸}_{1}=(5.0\\text{km})\\text{cos}90\\text{Â°}=0{D}_{1y}={D}_{1}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{1}=(5.0\\text{km})\\text{sin}90\\text{Â°}=5.0\\text{km}{{D}_{2x}={D}_{2}\\text{cos}{Î¸}_{2}=(3.0\\text{km})\\text{cos}180\\text{Â°}=â3.0\\text{km}{D}_{2y}={D}_{2}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{2}=(3.0\\text{km})\\text{sin}180\\text{Â°}=0{{D}_{3x}={D}_{3}\\text{cos}{Î¸}_{3}=(4.0\\text{km})\\text{cos}225\\text{Â°}=â2.8\\text{km}{D}_{3y}={D}_{3}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{3}=(4.0\\text{km})\\text{sin}225\\text{Â°}=â2.8\\text{km}.{{D}_{1x}={D}_{1}\\text{cos}{Î¸}_{1}=(5.0\\text{km})\\text{cos}90\\text{Â°}=0{D}_{1y}={D}_{1}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{1}=(5.0\\text{km})\\text{sin}90\\text{Â°}=5.0\\text{km}{{D}_{2x}={D}_{2}\\text{cos}{Î¸}_{2}=(3.0\\text{km})\\text{cos}180\\text{Â°}=â3.0\\text{km}{D}_{2y}={D}_{2}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{2}=(3.0\\text{km})\\text{sin}180\\text{Â°}=0{{D}_{3x}={D}_{3}\\text{cos}{Î¸}_{3}=(4.0\\text{km})\\text{cos}225\\text{Â°}=â2.8\\text{km}{D}_{3y}={D}_{3}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{3}=(4.0\\text{km})\\text{sin}225\\text{Â°}=â2.8\\text{km}.$\n\nScalar components of the net displacement vector are\n\n${{D}_{x}={D}_{1x}+{D}_{2x}+{D}_{3x}=(0â3.0â2.8)\\text{km}=â5.8\\text{km}{D}_{y}={D}_{1y}+{D}_{2y}+{D}_{3y}=(5.0+0â2.8)\\text{km}=+2.2\\text{km}.{{D}_{x}={D}_{1x}+{D}_{2x}+{D}_{3x}=(0â3.0â2.8)\\text{km}=â5.8\\text{km}{D}_{y}={D}_{1y}+{D}_{2y}+{D}_{3y}=(5.0+0â2.8)\\text{km}=+2.2\\text{km}.$\n\nHence, the skierâs net displacement vector is\n\n$Dâ={D}_{x}i^+{D}_{y}j^=(â5.8i^+2.2j^)\\text{km}Dâ={D}_{x}i^+{D}_{y}j^=(â5.8i^+2.2j^)\\text{km}$\n\n. On the way back to the lodge, their displacement is\n\n$Bâ=\\text{â}Dâ=\\text{â}(â5.8i^+2.2j^)\\text{km}=(5.8i^â2.2j^)\\text{km}Bâ=\\text{â}Dâ=\\text{â}(â5.8i^+2.2j^)\\text{km}=(5.8i^â2.2j^)\\text{km}$\n\n.

Figures are required when using a graphical method; however, we can check if our solution makes sense by sketching it, which is a useful final step in solving any vector problem.\n\nExample\n\n2.13\n\nDisplacement of a Jogger\n\nA jogger runs up a flight of 200 identical steps to the top of a hill and then runs along the top of the hill 50.0 m before he stops at a drinking fountain (\n\nFigure 2.26\n\n). His displacement vector from point\n\nA\n\nat the bottom of the steps to point\n\nB\n\nat the fountain is\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}=(â90.0i^+30.0j^)\\text{m}{Dâ}_{AB}=(â90.0i^+30.0j^)\\text{m}$\n\n. What is the height and width of each step in the flight? What is the actual distance the jogger covers? If he makes a loop and returns to point\n\nA\n\n, what is his net displacement vector?\n\nFigure\n\n2.26\n\nA jogger runs up a flight of steps.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe displacement vector\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}{Dâ}_{AB}$\n\nis the vector sum of the joggerâs displacement vector\n\n${Dâ}_{AT}{Dâ}_{AT}$\n\nalong the stairs (from point\n\nA\n\nat the bottom of the stairs to point\n\nT\n\nat the top of the stairs) and his displacement vector\n\n${Dâ}_{TB}{Dâ}_{TB}$\n\non the top of the hill (from point\n\nT\n\nat the top of the stairs to the fountain at point\n\nB\n\n). We must find the horizontal and the vertical components of\n\n${Dâ}_{AT}{Dâ}_{AT}$\n\n. If each step has width\n\nw\n\nand height\n\nh\n\n, the horizontal component of\n\n${Dâ}_{AT}{Dâ}_{AT}$\n\nmust have a length of 200\n\nw\n\nand the vertical component must have a length of 200\n\nh.\n\nThe actual distance the jogger covers is the sum of the distance he runs up the stairs and the distance of 50.0 m that he runs along the top of the hill.\n\nSolution\n\nIn the coordinate system indicated in\n\nFigure 2.26\n\n, the joggerâs displacement vector on the top of the hill is\n\n${Dâ}_{TB}=(â50.0\\text{m})i^{Dâ}_{TB}=(â50.0\\text{m})i^$\n\n. His net displacement vector is\n\n${Dâ}_{AB}={Dâ}_{AT}+{Dâ}_{TB}.{Dâ}_{AB}={Dâ}_{AT}+{Dâ}_{TB}.$\n\nTherefore, his displacement vector\n\n${Dâ}_{AT}{Dâ}_{AT}$\n\nalong the stairs is\n\n${Dâ}_{AT}={Dâ}_{AB}â{Dâ}_{TB}=(â90.0i^+30.0j^)\\text{m}â(â50.0\\text{m})i^=[(â90.0+50.0)i^+30.0j^]\\text{m}=(â40.0i^+30.0j^)\\text{m}.{Dâ}_{AT}={Dâ}_{AB}â{Dâ}_{TB}=(â90.0i^+30.0j^)\\text{m}â(â50.0\\text{m})i^=[(â90.0+50.0)i^+30.0j^]\\text{m}=(â40.0i^+30.0j^)\\text{m}.$\n\nIts scalar components are\n\n${D}_{ATx}=â40.0\\text{m}{D}_{ATx}=â40.0\\text{m}$\n\nand\n\n${D}_{ATy}=30.0\\text{m}{D}_{ATy}=30.0\\text{m}$\n\n. Therefore, we must have\n\n$200w=|â40.0|\\text{m}\\text{and}200h=30.0\\text{m}.200w=|â40.0|\\text{m}\\text{and}200h=30.0\\text{m}.$\n\nHence, the step width is\n\nw\n\n= 40.0 m/200 = 0.2 m = 20 cm, and the step height is\n\nh\n\n= 30.0 m/200 = 0.15 m = 15 cm. The distance that the jogger covers along the stairs is\n\n${D}_{AT}=\\sqrt{{D}_{ATx}^{2}+{D}_{ATy}^{2}}=\\sqrt{{(â40.0)}^{2}+{(30.0)}^{2}}\\text{m}=50.0\\text{m}.{D}_{AT}=\\sqrt{{D}_{ATx}^{2}+{D}_{ATy}^{2}}=\\sqrt{{(â40.0)}^{2}+{(30.0)}^{2}}\\text{m}=50.0\\text{m}.$\n\nThus, the actual distance he runs is\n\n${D}_{AT}+{D}_{TB}=50.0\\text{m}+50.0\\text{m}=100.0\\text{m}{D}_{AT}+{D}_{TB}=50.0\\text{m}+50.0\\text{m}=100.0\\text{m}$\n\n. When he makes a loop and comes back from the fountain to his initial position at point\n\nA\n\n, the total distance he covers is twice this distance, or 200.0 m. However, his net displacement vector is zero, because when his final position is the same as his initial position, the scalar components of his net displacement vector are zero (\n\nEquation 2.13\n\n).\n\nIn many physical situations, we often need to know the direction of a vector. For example, we may want to know the direction of a magnetic field vector at some point or the direction of motion of an object. We have already said direction is given by a unit vector, which is a dimensionless entityâthat is, it has no physical units associated with it. When the vector in question lies along one of the axes in a Cartesian system of coordinates, the answer is simple, because then its unit vector of direction is either parallel or antiparallel to the direction of the unit vector of an axis. For example, the direction of vector\n\n$dâ=â5\\text{m}i^dâ=â5\\text{m}i^$\n\nis unit vector\n\n$d^=\\text{â}i^d^=\\text{â}i^$\n\n. The general rule of finding the unit vector\n\n$V^V^$\n\nof direction for any vector\n\n$VâVâ$\n\nis to divide it by its magnitude\n\nV\n\n:\n\n$V^=\\frac{Vâ}{V}.V^=\\frac{Vâ}{V}.$\n\n2.26\n\nWe see from this expression that the unit vector of direction is indeed dimensionless because the numerator and the denominator in\n\nEquation 2.26\n\nhave the same physical unit. In this way,\n\nEquation 2.26\n\nallows us to express the unit vector of direction in terms of unit vectors of the axes. The following example illustrates this principle.\n\nExample\n\n2.14\n\nThe Unit Vector of Direction\n\nIf the velocity vector of the military convoy in\n\nExample 2.8\n\nis\n\n$vâ=(4.000i^+3.000j^+0.100k^)\\text{km}\\text{/}\\text{h}vâ=(4.000i^+3.000j^+0.100k^)\\text{km}\\text{/}\\text{h}$\n\n, what is the unit vector of its direction of motion?\n\nStrategy\n\nThe unit vector of the convoyâs direction of motion is the unit vector\n\n$v^v^$\n\nthat is parallel to the velocity vector. The unit vector is obtained by dividing a vector by its magnitude, in accordance with\n\nEquation 2.26\n\n.\n\nSolution\n\nThe magnitude of the vector\n\n$vâvâ$\n\nis\n\n$v=\\sqrt{{v}_{x}^{2}+{v}_{y}^{2}+{v}_{z}^{2}}=\\sqrt{{4.000}^{2}+{3.000}^{2}+{0.100}^{2}}\\text{km}\\text{/}\\text{h}=5.001\\text{km}\\text{/}\\text{h}.v=\\sqrt{{v}_{x}^{2}+{v}_{y}^{2}+{v}_{z}^{2}}=\\sqrt{{4.000}^{2}+{3.000}^{2}+{0.100}^{2}}\\text{km}\\text{/}\\text{h}=5.001\\text{km}\\text{/}\\text{h}.$\n\nTo obtain the unit vector\n\n$v^v^$\n\n, divide\n\n$vâvâ$\n\nby its magnitude:\n\n$v^=\\frac{vâ}{v}=\\frac{(4.000i^+3.000j^+0.100k^)\\text{km}\\text{/}\\text{h}}{5.001\\text{km}\\text{/}\\text{h}}=\\frac{(4.000i^+3.000j^+0.100k^)}{5.001}=\\frac{4.000}{5.001}i^+\\frac{3.000}{5.001}j^+\\frac{0.100}{5.001}k^=(79.98i^+59.99j^+2.00k^)Ã{10}^{â2}.v^=\\frac{vâ}{v}=\\frac{(4.000i^+3.000j^+0.100k^)\\text{km}\\text{/}\\text{h}}{5.001\\text{km}\\text{/}\\text{h}}=\\frac{(4.000i^+3.000j^+0.100k^)}{5.001}=\\frac{4.000}{5.001}i^+\\frac{3.000}{5.001}j^+\\frac{0.100}{5.001}k^=(79.98i^+59.99j^+2.00k^)Ã{10}^{â2}.$\n\nSignificance\n\nNote that when using the analytical method with a calculator, it is advisable to carry out your calculations to at least three decimal places and then round off the final answer to the required number of significant figures, which is the way we performed calculations in this example. If you round off your partial answer too early, you risk your final answer having a huge numerical error, and it may be far off from the exact answer or from a value measured in an experiment.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n2.10\n\nVerify that vector\n\n$v^v^$\n\nobtained in\n\nExample 2.14\n\nis indeed a unit vector by computing its magnitude. If the convoy in\n\nExample 2.8\n\nwas moving across a desert flatlandâthat is, if the third component of its velocity was zeroâwhat is the unit vector of its direction of motion? Which geographic direction does it represent?"

There are two kinds of products of vectors used broadly in physics and engineering. One kind of multiplication is a\n\nscalar multiplication of two vectors\n\n. Taking a scalar product of two vectors results in a number (a scalar), as its name indicates. Scalar products are used to define work and energy relations. For example, the work that a force (a vector) performs on an object while causing its displacement (a vector) is defined as a scalar product of the force vector with the displacement vector. A quite different kind of multiplication is a\n\nvector multiplication of vectors\n\n. Taking a vector product of two vectors returns as a result a vector, as its name suggests. Vector products are used to define other derived vector quantities. For example, in describing rotations, a vector quantity called\n\ntorque\n\nis defined as a vector product of an applied force (a vector) and its distance from pivot to force (a vector). It is important to distinguish between these two kinds of vector multiplications because the scalar product is a scalar quantity and a vector product is a vector quantity.\n\nThe Scalar Product of Two Vectors (the Dot Product)\n\nScalar multiplication of two vectors yields a scalar product.\n\nScalar Product (Dot Product)\n\nThe\n\nscalar product\n\n$AâÂ·BâAâÂ·Bâ$\n\nof two vectors\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nand\n\n$BâBâ$\n\nis a number defined by the equation\n\n$AâÂ·Bâ=AB\\text{cos}Ï,AâÂ·Bâ=AB\\text{cos}Ï,$\n\n2.27\n\nwhere\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\nis the angle between the vectors (shown in\n\nFigure 2.27\n\n). The scalar product is also called the\n\ndot product\n\nbecause of the dot notation that indicates it.\n\nIn the definition of the dot product, the direction of angle\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\ndoes not matter, and\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\ncan be measured from either of the two vectors to the other because\n\n$\\text{cos}Ï=\\text{cos}(\\text{â}Ï)=\\text{cos}(2ÏâÏ)\\text{cos}Ï=\\text{cos}(\\text{â}Ï)=\\text{cos}(2ÏâÏ)$\n\n. The dot product is a negative number when\n\n$90\\text{Â°}<Ïâ¤180\\text{Â°}90\\text{Â°}<Ïâ¤180\\text{Â°}$\n\nand is a positive number when\n\n$0\\text{Â°}â¤Ï<90\\text{Â°}0\\text{Â°}â¤Ï<90\\text{Â°}$\n\n. Moreover, the dot product of two parallel vectors is\n\n$AâÂ·Bâ=AB\\text{cos}0\\text{Â°}=ABAâÂ·Bâ=AB\\text{cos}0\\text{Â°}=AB$\n\n, and the dot product of two antiparallel vectors is\n\n$AâÂ·Bâ=AB\\text{cos}180\\text{Â°}=\\text{â}ABAâÂ·Bâ=AB\\text{cos}180\\text{Â°}=\\text{â}AB$\n\n.

(b) Turn clockwise to tighten the nut.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe adopt the frame of reference shown in\n\nFigure 2.31\n\n, where vectors\n\n$RâRâ$\n\nand\n\n$FâFâ$\n\nlie in the\n\nxy\n\n-plane and the origin is at the position of the nut. The radial direction along vector\n\n$RâRâ$\n\n(pointing away from the origin) is the reference direction for measuring the angle\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\nbecause\n\n$RâRâ$\n\nis the first vector in the vector product\n\n$Ïâ=RâÃFâÏâ=RâÃFâ$\n\n. Vector\n\n$ÏâÏâ$\n\nmust lie along the\n\nz\n\n-axis because this is the axis that is perpendicular to the\n\nxy\n\n-plane, where both\n\n$RâRâ$\n\nand\n\n$FâFâ$\n\nlie. To compute the magnitude\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\n, we use\n\nEquation 2.35\n\n. To find the direction of\n\n$ÏâÏâ$\n\n, we use the corkscrew right-hand rule (\n\nFigure 2.30\n\n).\n\nSolution\n\nFor the situation in (a), the corkscrew rule gives the direction of\n\n$RâÃFâRâÃFâ$\n\nin the positive direction of the\n\nz\n\n-axis. Physically, it means the torque vector\n\n$ÏâÏâ$\n\npoints out of the page, perpendicular to the wrench handle. We identify\n\nF\n\n= 20.00 N and\n\nR\n\n= 0.25 m, and compute the magnitude using\n\nEquation 2.35\n\n:\n\n$Ï=|RâÃFâ|=RF\\text{sin}Ï=(0.25\\text{m})(20.00\\text{N})\\text{sin}40\\text{Â°}=3.21\\text{N}Â·\\text{m}.Ï=|RâÃFâ|=RF\\text{sin}Ï=(0.25\\text{m})(20.00\\text{N})\\text{sin}40\\text{Â°}=3.21\\text{N}Â·\\text{m}.$\n\nFor the situation in (b), the corkscrew rule gives the direction of\n\n$RâÃFâRâÃFâ$\n\nin the negative direction of the\n\nz\n\n-axis. Physically, it means the vector\n\n$ÏâÏâ$\n\npoints into the page, perpendicular to the wrench handle. The magnitude of this torque is\n\n$Ï=|RâÃFâ|=RF\\text{sin}Ï=(0.25\\text{m})(20.00\\text{N})\\text{sin}45\\text{Â°}=3.53\\text{N}Â·\\text{m}.Ï=|RâÃFâ|=RF\\text{sin}Ï=(0.25\\text{m})(20.00\\text{N})\\text{sin}45\\text{Â°}=3.53\\text{N}Â·\\text{m}.$\n\nThe torque has the largest value when\n\n$\\text{sin}Ï=1\\text{sin}Ï=1$\n\n, which happens when\n\n$Ï=90\\text{Â°}Ï=90\\text{Â°}$\n\n. Physically, it means the wrench is most effectiveâgiving us the best mechanical advantageâwhen we apply the force perpendicular to the wrench handle. For the situation in this example, this best-torque value is\n\n${Ï}_{\\text{best}}=RF=(0.25\\text{m})(20.00\\text{N})=5.00\\text{N}Â·\\text{m}{Ï}_{\\text{best}}=RF=(0.25\\text{m})(20.00\\text{N})=5.00\\text{N}Â·\\text{m}$\n\n.\n\nSignificance\n\nWhen solving mechanics problems, we often do not need to use the corkscrew rule at all, as weâll see now in the following equivalent solution. Notice that once we have identified that vector\n\n$RâÃFâRâÃFâ$\n\nlies along the\n\nz\n\n-axis, we can write this vector in terms of the unit vector\n\n$k^k^$\n\nof the\n\nz\n\n-axis:\n\n$RâÃFâ=RF\\text{sin}Ïk^.RâÃFâ=RF\\text{sin}Ïk^.$\n\nIn this equation, the number that multiplies\n\n$k^k^$\n\nis the scalar\n\nz\n\n-component of the vector\n\n$RâÃFâRâÃFâ$\n\n. In the computation of this component, care must be taken that the angle\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\nis measured\n\ncounterclockwise\n\nfrom\n\n$RâRâ$\n\n(first vector) to\n\n$FâFâ$\n\n(second vector). Following this principle for the angles, we obtain\n\n$RF\\text{sin}(+40\\text{Â°})=+3.2\\text{N}Â·\\text{m}RF\\text{sin}(+40\\text{Â°})=+3.2\\text{N}Â·\\text{m}$\n\nfor the situation in (a), and we obtain\n\n$RF\\text{sin}(â45\\text{Â°})=â3.5\\text{N}Â·\\text{m}RF\\text{sin}(â45\\text{Â°})=â3.5\\text{N}Â·\\text{m}$\n\nfor the situation in (b). In the latter case, the angle is negative because the graph in\n\nFigure 2.31\n\nindicates the angle is measured clockwise; but, the same result is obtained when this angle is measured counterclockwise because\n\n$+(360\\text{Â°}â45\\text{Â°})=+315\\text{Â°}+(360\\text{Â°}â45\\text{Â°})=+315\\text{Â°}$\n\nand\n\n$\\text{sin}(+315\\text{Â°})=\\text{sin}(â45\\text{Â°})\\text{sin}(+315\\text{Â°})=\\text{sin}(â45\\text{Â°})$\n\n. In this way, we obtain the solution without reference to the corkscrew rule. For the situation in (a), the solution is\n\n$RâÃFâ=+3.2\\text{N}Â·\\text{m}k^RâÃFâ=+3.2\\text{N}Â·\\text{m}k^$\n\n; for the situation in (b), the solution is\n\n$RâÃFâ=â3.5\\text{N}Â·\\text{m}k^RâÃFâ=â3.5\\text{N}Â·\\text{m}k^$\n\n.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n2.15\n\nFor the vectors given in\n\nFigure 2.13\n\n, find the vector products\n\n$AâÃBâAâÃBâ$\n\nand\n\n$CâÃFâCâÃFâ$\n\n.\n\nSimilar to the dot product (\n\nEquation 2.32\n\n), the cross product has the following distributive property:\n\n$AâÃ(Bâ+Câ)=AâÃBâ+AâÃCâ.AâÃ(Bâ+Câ)=AâÃBâ+AâÃCâ.$\n\n2.37\n\nThe distributive property is applied frequently when vectors are expressed in their component forms, in terms of unit vectors of Cartesian axes.\n\nWhen we apply the definition of the cross product,\n\nEquation 2.35\n\n, to unit vectors\n\n$i^i^$\n\n,\n\n$j^j^$\n\n, and\n\n$k^k^$\n\nthat define the positive\n\nx\n\n-,\n\ny\n\n-, and\n\nz\n\n-directions in space, we find that\n\n$i^Ãi^=j^Ãj^=k^Ãk^=0.i^Ãi^=j^Ãj^=k^Ãk^=0.$\n\n2.38\n\nAll other cross products of these three unit vectors must be vectors of unit magnitudes because\n\n$i^i^$\n\n,\n\n$j^j^$\n\n, and\n\n$k^k^$\n\nare orthogonal. For example, for the pair\n\n$i^i^$\n\nand\n\n$j^j^$\n\n, the magnitude is\n\n$|i^Ãj^|=ij\\text{sin}90\\text{Â°}=(1)(1)(1)=1|i^Ãj^|=ij\\text{sin}90\\text{Â°}=(1)(1)(1)=1$\n\n. The direction of the vector product\n\n$i^Ãj^i^Ãj^$\n\nmust be orthogonal to the\n\nxy\n\n-plane, which means it must be along the\n\nz\n\n-axis. The only unit vectors along the\n\nz\n\n-axis are\n\n$\\text{â}k^\\text{â}k^$\n\nor\n\n$+k^+k^$\n\n. By the corkscrew rule, the direction of vector\n\n$i^Ãj^i^Ãj^$\n\nmust be parallel to the positive\n\nz\n\n-axis. Therefore, the result of the multiplication\n\n$i^Ãj^i^Ãj^$\n\nis identical to\n\n$+k^+k^$\n\n. We can repeat similar reasoning for the remaining pairs of unit vectors. The results of these multiplications are\n\n${i^Ãj^=+k^,j^Ãk^=+i^,k^Ãi^=+j^.{i^Ãj^=+k^,j^Ãk^=+i^,k^Ãi^=+j^.$\n\n2.39\n\nNotice that in\n\nEquation 2.39\n\n, the three unit vectors\n\n$i^i^$\n\n,\n\n$j^j^$\n\n, and\n\n$k^k^$\n\nappear in the\n\ncyclic order\n\nshown in a diagram in\n\nFigure 2.32\n\n(a). The cyclic order means that in the product formula,\n\n$i^i^$\n\nfollows\n\n$k^k^$\n\nand comes before\n\n$j^j^$\n\n, or\n\n$k^k^$\n\nfollows\n\n$j^j^$\n\nand comes before\n\n$i^i^$\n\n, or\n\n$j^j^$\n\nfollows\n\n$i^i^$\n\nand comes before\n\n$k^k^$\n\n. The cross product of two different unit vectors is always a third unit vector. When two unit vectors in the cross product appear in the cyclic order, the result of such a multiplication is the remaining unit vector, as illustrated in\n\nFigure 2.32\n\n(b). When unit vectors in the cross product appear in a different order, the result is a unit vector that is antiparallel to the remaining unit vector (i.e., the result is with the minus sign, as shown by the examples in\n\nFigure 2.32\n\n(c) and\n\nFigure 2.32\n\n(d). In practice, when the task is to find cross products of vectors that are given in vector component form, this rule for the cross-multiplication of unit vectors is very useful.\n\nFigure\n\n2.32\n\n(a) The diagram of the cyclic order of the unit vectors of the axes. (b) The only cross products where the unit vectors appear in the cyclic order. These products have the positive sign. (c, d) Two examples of cross products where the unit vectors do not appear in the cyclic order. These products have the negative sign.\n\nSuppose we want to find the cross product\n\n$AâÃBâAâÃBâ$\n\nfor vectors\n\n$Aâ={A}_{x}i^+{A}_{y}j^+{A}_{z}k^Aâ={A}_{x}i^+{A}_{y}j^+{A}_{z}k^$\n\nand\n\n$Bâ={B}_{x}i^+{B}_{y}j^+{B}_{z}k^Bâ={B}_{x}i^+{B}_{y}j^+{B}_{z}k^$\n\n. We can use the distributive property (\n\nEquation 2.37\n\n), the anticommutative property (\n\nEquation 2.36\n\n), and the results in\n\nEquation 2.38\n\nand\n\nEquation 2.39\n\nfor unit vectors to perform the following algebra:\n\n$AâÃBâ=({A}_{x}i^+{A}_{y}j^+{A}_{z}k^)Ã({B}_{x}i^+{B}_{y}j^+{B}_{z}k^)={A}_{x}i^Ã({B}_{x}i^+{B}_{y}j^+{B}_{z}k^)+{A}_{y}j^Ã({B}_{x}i^+{B}_{y}j^+{B}_{z}k^)+{A}_{z}k^Ã({B}_{x}i^+{B}_{y}j^+{B}_{z}k^)={A}_{x}{B}_{x}i^Ãi^+{A}_{x}{B}_{y}i^Ãj^+{A}_{x}{B}_{z}i^Ãk^+{A}_{y}{B}_{x}j^Ãi^+{A}_{y}{B}_{y}j^Ãj^+{A}_{y}{B}_{z}j^Ãk^+{A}_{z}{B}_{x}k^Ãi^+{A}_{z}{B}_{y}k^Ãj^+{A}_{z}{B}_{z}k^Ãk^={A}_{x}{B}_{x}(0)+{A}_{x}{B}_{y}(+k^)+{A}_{x}{B}_{z}(\\text{â}j^)+{A}_{y}{B}_{x}(\\text{â}k^)+{A}_{y}{B}_{y}(0)+{A}_{y}{B}_{z}(+i^)+{A}_{z}{B}_{x}(+j^)+{A}_{z}{B}_{y}(\\text{â}i^)+{A}_{z}{B}_{z}(0).AâÃBâ=({A}_{x}i^+{A}_{y}j^+{A}_{z}k^)Ã({B}_{x}i^+{B}_{y}j^+{B}_{z}k^)={A}_{x}i^Ã({B}_{x}i^+{B}_{y}j^+{B}_{z}k^)+{A}_{y}j^Ã({B}_{x}i^+{B}_{y}j^+{B}_{z}k^)+{A}_{z}k^Ã({B}_{x}i^+{B}_{y}j^+{B}_{z}k^)={A}_{x}{B}_{x}i^Ãi^+{A}_{x}{B}_{y}i^Ãj^+{A}_{x}{B}_{z}i^Ãk^+{A}_{y}{B}_{x}j^Ãi^+{A}_{y}{B}_{y}j^Ãj^+{A}_{y}{B}_{z}j^Ãk^+{A}_{z}{B}_{x}k^Ãi^+{A}_{z}{B}_{y}k^Ãj^+{A}_{z}{B}_{z}k^Ãk^={A}_{x}{B}_{x}(0)+{A}_{x}{B}_{y}(+k^)+{A}_{x}{B}_{z}(\\text{â}j^)+{A}_{y}{B}_{x}(\\text{â}k^)+{A}_{y}{B}_{y}(0)+{A}_{y}{B}_{z}(+i^)+{A}_{z}{B}_{x}(+j^)+{A}_{z}{B}_{y}(\\text{â}i^)+{A}_{z}{B}_{z}(0).$\n\nWhen performing algebraic operations involving the cross product, be very careful about keeping the correct order of multiplication because the cross product is anticommutative. The last two steps that we still have to do to complete our task are, first, grouping the terms that contain a common unit vector and, second, factoring. In this way we obtain the following very useful expression for the computation of the cross product:\n\n$Câ=AâÃBâ=({A}_{y}{B}_{z}â{A}_{z}{B}_{y})i^+({A}_{z}{B}_{x}â{A}_{x}{B}_{z})j^+({A}_{x}{B}_{y}â{A}_{y}{B}_{x})k^.Câ=AâÃBâ=({A}_{y}{B}_{z}â{A}_{z}{B}_{y})i^+({A}_{z}{B}_{x}â{A}_{x}{B}_{z})j^+({A}_{x}{B}_{y}â{A}_{y}{B}_{x})k^.$\n\n2.40\n\nIn this expression, the scalar components of the cross-product vector are\n\n${{C}_{x}={A}_{y}{B}_{z}â{A}_{z}{B}_{y},{C}_{y}={A}_{z}{B}_{x}â{A}_{x}{B}_{z},{C}_{z}={A}_{x}{B}_{y}â{A}_{y}{B}_{x}.{{C}_{x}={A}_{y}{B}_{z}â{A}_{z}{B}_{y},{C}_{y}={A}_{z}{B}_{x}â{A}_{x}{B}_{z},{C}_{z}={A}_{x}{B}_{y}â{A}_{y}{B}_{x}.$\n\n2.41\n\nWhen finding the cross product, in practice, we can use either\n\nEquation 2.35\n\nor\n\nEquation 2.40\n\n, depending on which one of them seems to be less complex computationally. They both lead to the same final result. One way to make sure if the final result is correct is to use them both.\n\nExample\n\n2.19\n\nA Particle in a Magnetic Field\n\nWhen moving in a magnetic field, some particles may experience a magnetic force. Without going into detailsâa detailed study of magnetic phenomena comes in later chaptersâletâs acknowledge that the magnetic field\n\n$BâBâ$\n\nis a vector, the magnetic force\n\n$FâFâ$\n\nis a vector, and the velocity\n\n$uâuâ$\n\nof the particle is a vector. The magnetic force vector is proportional to the vector product of the velocity vector with the magnetic field vector, which we express as\n\n$Fâ=Î¶uâÃBâFâ=Î¶uâÃBâ$\n\n. In this equation, a constant\n\n$Î¶Î¶$\n\ntakes care of the consistency in physical units, so we can omit physical units on vectors\n\n$uâuâ$\n\nand\n\n$BâBâ$\n\n. In this example, letâs assume the constant\n\n$Î¶Î¶$\n\nis positive.\n\nA particle moving in space with velocity vector\n\n$uâ=â5.0i^â2.0j^+3.5k^uâ=â5.0i^â2.0j^+3.5k^$\n\nenters a region with a magnetic field and experiences a magnetic force.

In each case, find magnitude\n\nF\n\nof the magnetic force and angle\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\nthe force vector\n\n$FâFâ$\n\nmakes with the given magnetic field vector\n\n$BâBâ$\n\n.\n\nStrategy\n\nFirst, we want to find the vector product\n\n$uâÃBâuâÃBâ$\n\n, because then we can determine the magnetic force using\n\n$Fâ=Î¶uâÃBâFâ=Î¶uâÃBâ$\n\n. Magnitude\n\nF\n\ncan be found either by using components,\n\n$F=\\sqrt{{F}_{x}^{2}+{F}_{y}^{2}+{F}_{z}^{2}}F=\\sqrt{{F}_{x}^{2}+{F}_{y}^{2}+{F}_{z}^{2}}$\n\n, or by computing the magnitude\n\n$|uâÃBâ||uâÃBâ|$\n\ndirectly using\n\nEquation 2.35\n\n. In the latter approach, we would have to find the angle between vectors\n\n$uâuâ$\n\nand\n\n$BâBâ$\n\n. When we have\n\n$FâFâ$\n\n, the general method for finding the direction angle\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\ninvolves the computation of the scalar product\n\n$FâÂ·BâFâÂ·Bâ$\n\nand substitution into\n\nEquation 2.34\n\n. To compute the vector product we can either use\n\nEquation 2.40\n\nor compute the product directly, whichever way is simpler.\n\nSolution\n\nThe components of the velocity vector are\n\n${u}_{x}=â5.0{u}_{x}=â5.0$\n\n,\n\n${u}_{y}=â2.0{u}_{y}=â2.0$\n\n, and\n\n${u}_{z}=3.5{u}_{z}=3.5$\n\n.\n\n(a) The components of the magnetic field vector are\n\n${B}_{x}=7.2{B}_{x}=7.2$\n\n,\n\n${B}_{y}=â1.0{B}_{y}=â1.0$\n\n, and\n\n${B}_{z}=â2.4{B}_{z}=â2.4$\n\n.

(We could have saved some time if we had computed the scalar product earlier.)\n\n(b) Because vector\n\n$Bâ=4.5k^Bâ=4.5k^$\n\nhas only one component, we can perform the algebra quickly and find the vector product directly:\n\n$Fâ=Î¶uâÃBâ=Î¶(â5.0i^â2.0j^+3.5k^)Ã(4.5k^)=Î¶[(â5.0)(4.5)i^Ãk^+(â2.0)(4.5)j^Ãk^+(3.5)(4.5)k^Ãk^]=Î¶[â22.5(\\text{â}j^)â9.0(+i^)+0]=Î¶(â9.0i^+22.5j^).Fâ=Î¶uâÃBâ=Î¶(â5.0i^â2.0j^+3.5k^)Ã(4.5k^)=Î¶[(â5.0)(4.5)i^Ãk^+(â2.0)(4.5)j^Ãk^+(3.5)(4.5)k^Ãk^]=Î¶[â22.5(\\text{â}j^)â9.0(+i^)+0]=Î¶(â9.0i^+22.5j^).$\n\nThe magnitude of the magnetic force is\n\n$F=\\sqrt{{F}_{x}^{2}+{F}_{y}^{2}+{F}_{z}^{2}}=Î¶\\sqrt{{(â9.0)}^{2}+{(22.5)}^{2}+{(0.0)}^{2}}=24.2Î¶.F=\\sqrt{{F}_{x}^{2}+{F}_{y}^{2}+{F}_{z}^{2}}=Î¶\\sqrt{{(â9.0)}^{2}+{(22.5)}^{2}+{(0.0)}^{2}}=24.2Î¶.$\n\nBecause the scalar product is\n\n$FâÂ·Bâ={F}_{x}{B}_{x}+{F}_{y}{B}_{y}+{F}_{z}{B}_{z}=(â9.0Î¶)(0)+(22.5Î¶)(0)+(0)(4.5)=0,FâÂ·Bâ={F}_{x}{B}_{x}+{F}_{y}{B}_{y}+{F}_{z}{B}_{z}=(â9.0Î¶)(0)+(22.5Î¶)(0)+(0)(4.5)=0,$\n\nthe magnetic force vector\n\n$FâFâ$\n\nis perpendicular to the magnetic field vector\n\n$BâBâ$\n\n.\n\nSignificance\n\nEven without actually computing the scalar product, we can predict that the magnetic force vector must always be perpendicular to the magnetic field vector because of the way this vector is constructed. Namely, the magnetic force vector is the vector product\n\n$Fâ=Î¶uâÃBâFâ=Î¶uâÃBâ$\n\nand, by the definition of the vector product (see\n\nFigure 2.29\n\n), vector\n\n$FâFâ$\n\nmust be perpendicular to both vectors\n\n$uâuâ$\n\nand\n\n$BâBâ$\n\n.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n2.16\n\nGiven two vectors\n\n$Aâ=\\text{â}i^+j^Aâ=\\text{â}i^+j^$\n\nand\n\n$Bâ=3i^âj^Bâ=3i^âj^$\n\n, find (a)\n\n$AâÃBâAâÃBâ$\n\n, (b)\n\n$|AâÃBâ||AâÃBâ|$\n\n, (c) the angle between\n\n$AâAâ$\n\nand\n\n$BâBâ$\n\n, and (d) the angle between\n\n$AâÃBâAâÃBâ$\n\nand vector\n\n$Câ=i^+k^Câ=i^+k^$\n\n.\n\nIn conclusion to this section, we want to stress that âdot productâ and âcross productâ are entirely different mathematical objects that have different meanings. The dot product is a scalar; the cross product is a vector. Later chapters use the terms\n\ndot product\n\nand\n\nscalar product\n\ninterchangeably. Similarly, the terms\n\ncross product\n\nand\n\nvector product\n\nare used interchangeably."

Knowing the distance alone is not enough to get to the town; we must also know the direction from the signpost to the town. The direction, together with the distance, is a vector quantity commonly called the displacement vector. A signpost, therefore, gives information about displacement vectors from the signpost to towns.

Many fundamental physical quantities are vectors, including displacement, velocity, force, and electric and magnetic vector fields. Scalar products of vectors define other fundamental scalar physical quantities, such as energy. Vector products of vectors define still other fundamental vector physical quantities, such as torque and angular momentum. In other words, vectors are a component part of physics in much the same way as sentences are a component part of literature.\n\nIn introductory physics, vectors are Euclidean quantities that have geometric representations as arrows in one dimension (in a line), in two dimensions (in a plane), or in three dimensions (in space). They can be added, subtracted, or multiplied. In this chapter, we explore elements of vector algebra for applications in mechanics and in electricity and magnetism. Vector operations also have numerous generalizations in other branches of physics."

    "chapter": 2,
    "content": "Summary\n\n2.1\n\nScalars and Vectors\n\nA vector quantity is any quantity that has magnitude and direction, such as displacement or velocity. Vector quantities are represented by mathematical objects called vectors.\n\nGeometrically, vectors are represented by arrows, with the end marked by an arrowhead. The length of the vector is its magnitude, which is a positive scalar. On a plane, the direction of a vector is given by the angle the vector makes with a reference direction, often an angle with the horizontal. The direction angle of a vector is a scalar.\n\nTwo vectors are equal if and only if they have the same magnitudes and directions. Parallel vectors have the same direction angles but may have different magnitudes. Antiparallel vectors have direction angles that differ by\n\n$180\\text{Â°}180\\text{Â°}$\n\n. Orthogonal vectors have direction angles that differ by\n\n$90\\text{Â°}90\\text{Â°}$\n\n.\n\nWhen a vector is multiplied by a scalar, the result is another vector of a different length than the length of the original vector. Multiplication by a positive scalar does not change the original direction; only the magnitude is affected. Multiplication by a negative scalar reverses the original direction. The resulting vector is antiparallel to the original vector. Multiplication by a scalar is distributive. Vectors can be divided by nonzero scalars but cannot be divided by vectors.\n\nTwo or more vectors can be added to form another vector. The vector sum is called the resultant vector. We can add vectors to vectors or scalars to scalars, but we cannot add scalars to vectors. Vector addition is commutative and associative.\n\nTo construct a resultant vector of two vectors in a plane geometrically, we use the parallelogram rule. To construct a resultant vector of many vectors in a plane geometrically, we use the tail-to-head method.\n\n2.2\n\nCoordinate Systems and Components of a Vector\n\nVectors are described in terms of their components in a coordinate system. In two dimensions (in a plane), vectors have two components. In three dimensions (in space), vectors have three components.\n\nA vector component of a vector is its part in an axis direction. The vector component is the product of the unit vector of an axis with its scalar component along this axis. A vector is the resultant of its vector components.\n\nScalar components of a vector are differences of coordinates, where coordinates of the origin are subtracted from end point coordinates of a vector. In a rectangular system, the magnitude of a vector is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.\n\nIn a plane, the direction of a vector is given by an angle the vector has with the positive\n\nx\n\n-axis. This direction angle is measured counterclockwise. The scalar\n\nx\n\n-component of a vector can be expressed as the product of its magnitude with the cosine of its direction angle, and the scalar\n\ny\n\n-component can be expressed as the product of its magnitude with the sine of its direction angle.\n\nIn a plane, there are two equivalent coordinate systems. The Cartesian coordinate system is defined by unit vectors\n\n$i^i^$\n\nand\n\n$j^j^$\n\nalong the\n\nx\n\n-axis and the\n\ny\n\n-axis, respectively. The polar coordinate system is defined by the radial unit vector\n\n$r^r^$\n\n, which gives the direction from the origin, and a unit vector\n\n$t^t^$\n\n, which is perpendicular (orthogonal) to the radial direction.\n\n2.3\n\nAlgebra of Vectors\n\nAnalytical methods of vector algebra allow us to find resultants of sums or differences of vectors without having to draw them. Analytical methods of vector addition are exact, contrary to graphical methods, which are approximate.\n\nAnalytical methods of vector algebra are used routinely in mechanics, electricity, and magnetism. They are important mathematical tools of physics.\n\n2.4\n\nProducts of Vectors\n\nThere are two kinds of multiplication for vectors. One kind of multiplication is the scalar product, also known as the dot product. The other kind of multiplication is the vector product, also known as the cross product. The scalar product of vectors is a number (scalar). The vector product of vectors is a vector.\n\nBoth kinds of multiplication have the distributive property, but only the scalar product has the commutative property. The vector product has the anticommutative property, which means that when we change the order in which two vectors are multiplied, the result acquires a minus sign.\n\nThe scalar product of two vectors is obtained by multiplying their magnitudes with the cosine of the angle between them. The scalar product of orthogonal vectors vanishes; the scalar product of antiparallel vectors is negative.\n\nThe vector product of two vectors is a vector perpendicular to both of them. Its magnitude is obtained by multiplying their magnitudes by the sine of the angle between them. The direction of the vector product can be determined by the corkscrew right-hand rule. The vector product of two either parallel or antiparallel vectors vanishes. The magnitude of the vector product is largest for orthogonal vectors.\n\nThe scalar product of vectors is used to find angles between vectors and in the definitions of derived scalar physical quantities such as work or energy.\n\nThe cross product of vectors is used in definitions of derived vector physical quantities such as torque or magnetic force, and in describing rotations."

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nDefine position, displacement, and distance traveled.\n\nCalculate the total displacement given the position as a function of time.\n\nDetermine the total distance traveled.\n\nCalculate the average velocity given the displacement and elapsed time.\n\nWhen youâre in motion, the basic questions to ask are: Where are you? Where are you going? How fast are you getting there? The answers to these questions require that you specify your position, your displacement, and your average velocityâthe terms we define in this section.\n\nPosition\n\nTo describe the motion of an object, you must first be able to describe its\n\nposition\n\n(\n\nx\n\n):\n\nwhere it is at any particular time\n\n. More precisely, we need to specify its position relative to a convenient frame of reference. A\n\nframe of reference\n\nis an arbitrary set of axes from which the position and motion of an object are described. Earth is often used as a frame of reference, and we often describe the position of an object as it relates to stationary objects on Earth. For example, a rocket launch could be described in terms of the position of the rocket with respect to Earth as a whole, whereas a cyclistâs position could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the buildings she passes\n\nFigure 3.2\n\n. In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion relative to Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not Earth, as the reference frame. To describe the position of an object undergoing one-dimensional motion, we often use the variable\n\nx\n\n. Later in the chapter, during the discussion of free fall, we use the variable\n\ny\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n3.2\n\nThese cyclists in Vietnam can be described by their position relative to buildings or a canal. Their motion can be described by their change in position, or displacement, in a frame of reference. (credit: modification of work by Suzan Black)\n\nDisplacement\n\nIf an object moves relative to a frame of referenceâfor example, if a professor moves to the right relative to a whiteboard\n\nFigure 3.3\n\nâthen the objectâs position changes. This change in position is called\n\ndisplacement\n\n. The word\n\ndisplacement\n\nimplies that an object has moved, or has been displaced. Although position is the numerical value of\n\nx\n\nalong a straight line where an object might be located, displacement gives the\n\nchange\n\nin position along this line. Since displacement indicates direction, it is a vector and can be either positive or negative, depending on the choice of positive direction. Also, an analysis of motion can have many displacements embedded in it. If right is positive and an object moves 2 m to the right, then 4 m to the left, the individual displacements are 2 m and\n\n$â4â4$\n\nm, respectively.\n\nFigure\n\n3.3\n\nA professor paces left and right while lecturing. Her position relative to Earth is given by\n\nx\n\n. The +2.0-m displacement of the professor relative to Earth is represented by an arrow pointing to the right.\n\nDisplacement\n\nDisplacement\n\n$\\text{Î}x\\text{Î}x$\n\nis the change in position of an object:\n\n$\\text{Î}x={x}_{\\text{f}}â{x}_{0},\\text{Î}x={x}_{\\text{f}}â{x}_{0},$\n\n3.1\n\nwhere\n\n$\\text{Î}x\\text{Î}x$\n\nis displacement,\n\n${x}_{\\text{f}}{x}_{\\text{f}}$\n\nis the final position, and\n\n${x}_{0}{x}_{0}$\n\nis the initial position.\n\nWe use the uppercase Greek letter delta (Î) to mean âchange inâ whatever quantity follows it; thus,\n\n$\\text{Î}x\\text{Î}x$\n\nmeans\n\nchange in position\n\n(final position less initial position). We always solve for displacement by subtracting initial position\n\n${x}_{0}{x}_{0}$\n\nfrom final position\n\n${x}_{\\text{f}}{x}_{\\text{f}}$\n\n. Note that the SI unit for displacement is the meter, but sometimes we use kilometers or other units of length. Keep in mind that when units other than meters are used in a problem, you may need to convert them to meters to complete the calculation (see\n\nAppendix B\n\n).\n\nObjects in motion can also have a series of displacements. In the previous example of the pacing professor, the individual displacements are 2 m and\n\n$â4â4$\n\nm, giving a total displacement of â2 m. We define\n\ntotal displacement\n\n$\\text{Î}{x}_{\\text{Total}}\\text{Î}{x}_{\\text{Total}}$\n\n, as\n\nthe sum of the individual displacements\n\n, and express this mathematically with the equation\n\n$\\text{Î}{x}_{\\text{Total}}=â\\text{Î}{x}_{\\text{i}},\\text{Î}{x}_{\\text{Total}}=â\\text{Î}{x}_{\\text{i}},$\n\n3.2\n\nwhere\n\n$\\text{Î}{x}_{i}\\text{Î}{x}_{i}$\n\nare the individual displacements. In the earlier example,\n\n$\\text{Î}{x}_{1}={x}_{1}â{x}_{0}=2â0=2\\text{m.}\\text{Î}{x}_{1}={x}_{1}â{x}_{0}=2â0=2\\text{m.}$\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$\\text{Î}{x}_{2}={x}_{2}â{x}_{1}=â2â(2)=â4\\text{m.}\\text{Î}{x}_{2}={x}_{2}â{x}_{1}=â2â(2)=â4\\text{m.}$\n\nThus,\n\n$\\text{Î}{x}_{\\text{Total}}=\\text{Î}{x}_{1}+\\text{Î}{x}_{2}=2â4=â2\\text{m}\\text{.}\\text{Î}{x}_{\\text{Total}}=\\text{Î}{x}_{1}+\\text{Î}{x}_{2}=2â4=â2\\text{m}\\text{.}$\n\nThe total displacement is 2 â 4 = â2 m along the\n\nx\n\n-axis. It is also useful to calculate the magnitude of the displacement, or its size. The magnitude of the displacement is always positive. This is the absolute value of the displacement, because displacement is a vector and cannot have a negative value of magnitude. In our example, the magnitude of the total displacement is 2 m, whereas the magnitudes of the individual displacements are 2 m and 4 m.\n\nThe magnitude of the total displacement should not be confused with the distance traveled. Distance traveled\n\n${x}_{\\text{Total}}{x}_{\\text{Total}}$\n\n, is the total length of the path traveled between two positions. In the previous problem, the\n\ndistance traveled\n\nis the sum of the magnitudes of the individual displacements:\n\n${x}_{\\text{Total}}=|\\text{Î}{x}_{1}|+|\\text{Î}{x}_{2}|=2+4=6\\text{m}\\text{.}{x}_{\\text{Total}}=|\\text{Î}{x}_{1}|+|\\text{Î}{x}_{2}|=2+4=6\\text{m}\\text{.}$\n\nAverage Velocity\n\nTo calculate the other physical quantities in kinematics we must introduce the time variable. The time variable allows us not only to state where the object is (its position) during its motion, but also how fast it is moving. How fast an object is moving is given by the rate at which the position changes with time.\n\nFor each position\n\n${x}_{\\text{i}}{x}_{\\text{i}}$\n\n, we assign a particular time\n\n${t}_{\\text{i}}{t}_{\\text{i}}$\n\n. If the details of the motion at each instant are not important, the rate is usually expressed as the\n\naverage velocity\n\n$v\\text{â}v\\text{â}$\n\n. This vector quantity is simply the total displacement between two points divided by the time taken to travel between them. The time taken to travel between two points is called the\n\nelapsed time\n\n$\\text{Î}t\\text{Î}t$\n\n.\n\nAverage Velocity\n\nIf\n\n${x}_{1}{x}_{1}$\n\nand\n\n${x}_{2}{x}_{2}$\n\nare the positions of an object at times\n\n${t}_{1}{t}_{1}$\n\nand\n\n${t}_{2}{t}_{2}$\n\n, respectively, then\n\n$\\text{Average velocity}=v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Displacement between two points}}{\\text{Time needed to make the displacement}}v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}x}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{{x}_{2}â{x}_{1}}{{t}_{2}â{t}_{1}}.\\text{Average velocity}=v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Displacement between two points}}{\\text{Time needed to make the displacement}}v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}x}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{{x}_{2}â{x}_{1}}{{t}_{2}â{t}_{1}}.$\n\n3.3\n\nIt is important to note that the average velocity is a vector and can be negative, depending on positions\n\n${x}_{1}{x}_{1}$\n\nand\n\n${x}_{2}{x}_{2}$\n\n.\n\nExample\n\n3.1\n\nDelivering Flyers\n\nJill sets out from her home to deliver flyers for her yard sale, traveling due east along her street lined with houses. At\n\n$0.50.5$\n\nkm and 9 minutes later she runs out of flyers and has to retrace her steps back to her house to get more. This takes an additional 9 minutes. After picking up more flyers, she sets out again on the same path, continuing where she left off, and ends up 1.0 km from her house. This third leg of her trip takes\n\n$1515$\n\nminutes. At this point she turns back toward her house, heading west. After\n\n$1.751.75$\n\nkm and\n\n$2525$\n\nminutes she stops to rest.\n\nWhat is Jillâs total displacement to the point where she stops to rest?\n\nWhat is the magnitude of the final displacement?\n\nWhat is the average velocity during her entire trip?\n\nWhat is the total distance traveled?\n\nMake a graph of position versus time.\n\nA sketch of Jillâs movements is shown in\n\nFigure 3.4\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n3.4\n\nTimeline of Jillâs movements.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe problem contains data on the various legs of Jillâs trip, so it would be useful to make a table of the physical quantities.

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nExplain the difference between average velocity and instantaneous velocity.\n\nDescribe the difference between velocity and speed.\n\nCalculate the instantaneous velocity given the mathematical equation for the position.\n\nCalculate the speed given the instantaneous velocity.\n\nWe have now seen how to calculate the average velocity between two positions. However, since objects in the real world move continuously through space and time, we would like to find the velocity of an object at any single point. We can find the velocity of the object anywhere along its path by using some fundamental principles of calculus. This section gives us better insight into the physics of motion and will be useful in later chapters.\n\nInstantaneous Velocity\n\nThe quantity that tells us how fast an object is moving anywhere along its path is the\n\ninstantaneous velocity\n\n, usually called simply\n\nvelocity\n\n. It is the average velocity between two points on the path in the limit that the time (and therefore the displacement) between the two events approaches zero. To illustrate this idea mathematically, we need to express position\n\nx\n\nas a continuous function of\n\nt\n\ndenoted by\n\nx\n\n(\n\nt\n\n). The expression for the average velocity between two points using this notation is\n\n$v\\text{â}=\\frac{x({t}_{2})âx({t}_{1})}{{t}_{2}â{t}_{1}}v\\text{â}=\\frac{x({t}_{2})âx({t}_{1})}{{t}_{2}â{t}_{1}}$\n\n. To find the instantaneous velocity at any position, we let\n\n${t}_{1}=t{t}_{1}=t$\n\nand\n\n${t}_{2}=t+\\text{Î}t{t}_{2}=t+\\text{Î}t$\n\n. After inserting these expressions into the equation for the average velocity and taking the limit as\n\n$\\text{Î}tâ0\\text{Î}tâ0$\n\n, we find the expression for the instantaneous velocity:\n\n$v(t)=\\text{lim}\\text{Î}tâ0\\frac{x(t+\\text{Î}t)âx(t)}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{dx(t)}{dt}.v(t)=\\text{lim}\\text{Î}tâ0\\frac{x(t+\\text{Î}t)âx(t)}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{dx(t)}{dt}.$\n\nInstantaneous Velocity\n\nThe instantaneous velocity of an object is the limit of the average velocity as the elapsed time approaches zero, or the derivative of\n\nx\n\nwith respect to\n\nt\n\n:\n\n$v(t)=\\frac{d}{dt}x(t).v(t)=\\frac{d}{dt}x(t).$\n\n3.4\n\nLike average velocity, instantaneous velocity is a vector with dimension of length per time. The instantaneous velocity at a specific time point\n\n${t}_{0}{t}_{0}$\n\nis the rate of change of the position function, which is the slope of the position function\n\n$x(t)x(t)$\n\nat\n\n${t}_{0}{t}_{0}$\n\n.\n\nFigure 3.6\n\nshows how the average velocity\n\n$v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}x}{\\text{Î}t}v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}x}{\\text{Î}t}$\n\nbetween two times approaches the instantaneous velocity at\n\n${t}_{0}.{t}_{0}.$\n\nThe instantaneous velocity is shown at time\n\n${t}_{0}{t}_{0}$\n\n, which happens to be at the maximum of the position function. The slope of the position graph is zero at this point, and thus the instantaneous velocity is zero. At other times,\n\n${t}_{1},{t}_{2}{t}_{1},{t}_{2}$\n\n, and so on, the instantaneous velocity is not zero because the slope of the position graph would be positive or negative. If the position function had a minimum, the slope of the position graph would also be zero, giving an instantaneous velocity of zero there as well. Thus, the zeros of the velocity function give the minimum and maximum of the position function.\n\nFigure\n\n3.6\n\nIn a graph of position versus time, the instantaneous velocity is the slope of the tangent line at a given point. The average velocities\n\n$v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}x}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{{x}_{\\text{f}}â{x}_{\\text{i}}}{{t}_{\\text{f}}â{t}_{\\text{i}}}v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}x}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{{x}_{\\text{f}}â{x}_{\\text{i}}}{{t}_{\\text{f}}â{t}_{\\text{i}}}$\n\nbetween times\n\n$\\text{Î}t={t}_{6}â{t}_{1},\\text{Î}t={t}_{5}â{t}_{2},\\text{and}\\text{Î}t={t}_{4}â{t}_{3}\\text{Î}t={t}_{6}â{t}_{1},\\text{Î}t={t}_{5}â{t}_{2},\\text{and}\\text{Î}t={t}_{4}â{t}_{3}$\n\nare shown. When\n\n$\\text{Î}tâ0\\text{Î}tâ0$\n\n, the average velocity approaches the instantaneous velocity at\n\n$t={t}_{0}t={t}_{0}$\n\n.\n\nExample\n\n3.2\n\nFinding Velocity from a Position-Versus-Time Graph\n\nGiven the position-versus-time graph of\n\nFigure 3.7\n\n, find the velocity-versus-time graph.\n\nFigure\n\n3.7\n\nThe object starts out in the positive direction, stops for a short time, and then reverses direction, heading back toward the origin. Notice that the object comes to rest instantaneously, which would require an infinite force. Thus, the graph is an approximation of motion in the real world. (The concept of force is discussed in\n\nNewtonâs Laws of Motion\n\n.)\n\nStrategy\n\nThe graph contains three straight lines during three time intervals. We find the velocity during each time interval by taking the slope of the line using the grid.\n\nSolution\n\nTime interval 0 s to 0.5 s:\n\n$v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}x}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{0.5\\text{m}â0.0\\text{m}}{0.5\\text{s}â0.0\\text{s}}=1.0\\text{m/s}v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}x}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{0.5\\text{m}â0.0\\text{m}}{0.5\\text{s}â0.0\\text{s}}=1.0\\text{m/s}$\n\nTime interval 0.5 s to 1.0 s:\n\n$v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}x}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{0.5\\text{m}â0.5\\text{m}}{1.0\\text{s}â0.5\\text{s}}=0.0\\text{m/s}v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}x}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{0.5\\text{m}â0.5\\text{m}}{1.0\\text{s}â0.5\\text{s}}=0.0\\text{m/s}$\n\nTime interval 1.0 s to 2.0 s:\n\n$v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}x}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{0.0\\text{m}â0.5\\text{m}}{2.0\\text{s}â1.0\\text{s}}=â0.5\\text{m/s}v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}x}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{0.0\\text{m}â0.5\\text{m}}{2.0\\text{s}â1.0\\text{s}}=â0.5\\text{m/s}$\n\nThe graph of these values of velocity versus time is shown in\n\nFigure 3.8\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n3.8\n\nThe velocity is positive for the first part of the trip, zero when the object is stopped, and negative when the object reverses direction.\n\nSignificance\n\nDuring the time interval between 0 s and 0.5 s, the objectâs position is moving away from the origin and the position-versus-time curve has a positive slope. At any point along the curve during this time interval, we can find the instantaneous velocity by taking its slope, which is +1 m/s, as shown in\n\nFigure 3.8\n\n. In the subsequent time interval, between 0.5 s and 1.0 s, the position doesnât change and we see the slope is zero. From 1.0 s to 2.0 s, the object is moving back toward the origin and the slope is â0.5 m/s. The object has reversed direction and has a negative velocity.\n\nSpeed\n\nIn everyday language, most people use the terms\n\nspeed\n\nand\n\nvelocity\n\ninterchangeably. In physics, however, they do not have the same meaning and are distinct concepts. One major difference is that speed has no direction; that is, speed is a scalar.\n\nWe can calculate the\n\naverage speed\n\nby finding the total distance traveled divided by the elapsed time:\n\n$\\text{Average speed}=s\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Elapsed time}}.\\text{Average speed}=s\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Elapsed time}}.$\n\n3.5\n\nAverage speed is not necessarily the same as the magnitude of the average velocity, which is found by dividing the magnitude of the total displacement by the elapsed time. For example, if a trip starts and ends at the same location, the total displacement is zero, and therefore the average velocity is zero. The average speed, however, is not zero, because the total distance traveled is greater than zero. If we take a road trip of 300 km and need to be at our destination at a certain time, then we would be interested in our average speed.\n\nHowever, we can calculate the\n\ninstantaneous speed\n\nfrom the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity:\n\n$\\text{Instantaneous speed}=|v(t)|.\\text{Instantaneous speed}=|v(t)|.$\n\n3.6\n\nIf a particle is moving along the\n\nx\n\n-axis at +7.0 m/s and another particle is moving along the same axis at â7.0 m/s, they have different velocities, but both have the same speed of 7.0 m/s. Some typical speeds are shown in the following table.\n\nSpeed\n\nm/s\n\nmi/h\n\nContinental drift\n\n${10}^{â7}{10}^{â7}$\n\n$2Ã{10}^{â7}2Ã{10}^{â7}$\n\nBrisk walk\n\n1.7\n\n3.9\n\nCyclist\n\n4.4\n\n10\n\nSprint runner\n\n12.2\n\n27\n\nRural speed limit\n\n24.6\n\n56\n\nOfficial land speed record\n\n341.1\n\n763\n\nSpeed of sound at sea level\n\n343\n\n768\n\nSpace shuttle on reentry\n\n7800\n\n17,500\n\nEscape velocity of Earth*\n\n11,200\n\n25,000\n\nOrbital speed of Earth around the Sun\n\n29,783\n\n66,623\n\nSpeed of light in a vacuum\n\n299,792,458\n\n670,616,629\n\nTable\n\n3.1\n\nSpeeds of Various Objects\n\n*Escape velocity is the velocity at which an object must be launched so that it overcomes Earthâs gravity and is not pulled back toward Earth.\n\nCalculating Instantaneous Velocity\n\nWhen calculating instantaneous velocity, we need to specify the explicit form of the position function\n\n$x(t)x(t)$\n\n. If each term in the\n\n$x(t)x(t)$\n\nequation has the form of\n\n$A{t}^{n}A{t}^{n}$\n\nwhere\n\n$AA$\n\nis a constant and\n\n$nn$\n\nis an integer, this can be differentiated using the power rule to be:\n\n$\\frac{d(A{t}^{n})}{dt}=An{t}^{nâ1}.\\frac{d(A{t}^{n})}{dt}=An{t}^{nâ1}.$\n\n3.7\n\nNote that if there are additional terms added together, this power rule of differentiation can be done multiple times and the solution is the sum of those terms. The following example illustrates the use of\n\nEquation 3.7\n\n.\n\nExample\n\n3.3\n\nInstantaneous Velocity Versus Average Velocity\n\nThe position of a particle is given by\n\n$x(t)=(3.0\\text{m/s})t+(0.5{\\text{m/s}}^{3}){t}^{3}x(t)=(3.0\\text{m/s})t+(0.5{\\text{m/s}}^{3}){t}^{3}$\n\n.\n\nUsing\n\nEquation 3.4\n\nand\n\nEquation 3.7\n\n, find the instantaneous velocity at\n\n$t=2.0t=2.0$\n\ns.\n\nCalculate the average velocity between 1.0 s and 3.0 s.\n\nStrategy\n\nEquation 3.4\n\ngives the instantaneous velocity of the particle as the derivative of the position function. Looking at the form of the position function given, we see that it is a polynomial in\n\nt\n\n. Therefore, we can use\n\nEquation 3.7\n\n, the power rule from calculus, to find the solution. We use\n\nEquation 3.6\n\nto calculate the average velocity of the particle.\n\nSolution\n\n$v(t)=\\frac{dx(t)}{dt}=(3.0\\text{m/s})+(1.5{\\text{m/s}}^{3}){t}^{2}v(t)=\\frac{dx(t)}{dt}=(3.0\\text{m/s})+(1.5{\\text{m/s}}^{3}){t}^{2}$\n\n.\n\nSubstituting\n\nt\n\n= 2.0 s into this equation gives\n\n$v(2.0\\text{s})=(3.0\\text{m/s})+(1.5{\\text{m/s}}^{3}){(2.0 s)}^{2}v(2.0\\text{s})=(3.0\\text{m/s})+(1.5{\\text{m/s}}^{3}){(2.0 s)}^{2}$\n\n.\n\nTo determine the average velocity of the particle between 1.0 s and 3.0 s, we calculate the values of\n\nx\n\n(1.0 s) and\n\nx\n\n(3.0 s):\n\n$x(1.0\\text{s})=[(3.0 m/s)(1.0 s)+(0.5{\\text{m/s}}^{3}){(1.0 s)}^{3}]=3.5\\text{m}x(1.0\\text{s})=[(3.0 m/s)(1.0 s)+(0.5{\\text{m/s}}^{3}){(1.0 s)}^{3}]=3.5\\text{m}$\n\n$x(3.0\\text{s})=[(3.0 m/s)(3.0 s)+(0.5{\\text{m/s}}^{3}){(3.0 s)}^{3}]=22.5\\text{m}x(3.0\\text{s})=[(3.0 m/s)(3.0 s)+(0.5{\\text{m/s}}^{3}){(3.0 s)}^{3}]=22.5\\text{m}$\n\nThen the average velocity is\n\n$v\\text{â}=\\frac{x(3.0\\text{s})âx(1.0\\text{s})}{t(3.0\\text{s})ât(1.0\\text{s})}=\\frac{(22.5â3.5)\\text{m}}{(3.0â1.0)\\text{s}}=9.5\\text{m/s}\\text{.}v\\text{â}=\\frac{x(3.0\\text{s})âx(1.0\\text{s})}{t(3.0\\text{s})ât(1.0\\text{s})}=\\frac{(22.5â3.5)\\text{m}}{(3.0â1.0)\\text{s}}=9.5\\text{m/s}\\text{.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nIn the limit that the time interval used to calculate\n\n$v\\text{â}v\\text{â}$\n\ngoes to zero, the value obtained for\n\n$v\\text{â}v\\text{â}$\n\nconverges to the value of\n\nv.\n\nExample\n\n3.4\n\nInstantaneous Velocity Versus Speed\n\nConsider the motion of a particle in which the position is\n\n$x(t)=(3.0\\text{m/s})tâ(3{\\text{m/s}}^{2}){t}^{2}x(t)=(3.0\\text{m/s})tâ(3{\\text{m/s}}^{2}){t}^{2}$\n\n.\n\nWhat is the instantaneous velocity at\n\nt\n\n= 0.25 s,\n\nt\n\n= 0.50 s, and\n\nt\n\n= 1.0 s?\n\nWhat is the speed of the particle at these times?\n\nStrategy\n\nThe instantaneous velocity is the derivative of the position function and the speed is the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity.

The speed gives the magnitude of the velocity. By graphing the position, velocity, and speed as functions of time, we can understand these concepts visually\n\nFigure 3.9\n\n. In (a), the graph shows the particle moving in the positive direction until\n\nt\n\n= 0.5 s, when it reverses direction. The reversal of direction can also be seen in (b) at 0.5 s where the velocity is zero and then turns negative. At 1.0 s it is back at the origin where it started. The particleâs velocity at 1.0 s in (b) is negative, because it is traveling in the negative direction. But in (c), however, its speed is positive and remains positive throughout the travel time. We can also interpret velocity as the slope of the position-versus-time graph. The slope of\n\nx\n\n(\n\nt\n\n) is decreasing toward zero, becoming zero at 0.5 s and increasingly negative thereafter. This analysis of comparing the graphs of position, velocity, and speed helps catch errors in calculations. The graphs must be consistent with each other and help interpret the calculations.\n\nFigure\n\n3.9\n\n(a) Position:\n\nx\n\n(\n\nt\n\n) versus time. (b) Velocity:\n\nv\n\n(\n\nt\n\n) versus time. The slope of the position graph is the velocity.

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nCalculate the average acceleration between two points in time.\n\nCalculate the instantaneous acceleration given the functional form of velocity.\n\nExplain the vector nature of instantaneous acceleration and velocity.\n\nExplain the difference between average acceleration and instantaneous acceleration.\n\nFind instantaneous acceleration at a specified time on a graph of velocity versus time.\n\nThe importance of understanding acceleration spans our day-to-day experience, as well as the vast reaches of outer space and the tiny world of subatomic physics. In everyday conversation, to\n\naccelerate\n\nmeans to speed up; applying the brake pedal causes a vehicle to slow down. We are familiar with the acceleration of our car, for example. The greater the acceleration, the greater the change in velocity over a given time. Acceleration is widely seen in experimental physics. In linear particle accelerator experiments, for example, subatomic particles are accelerated to very high velocities in collision experiments, which tell us information about the structure of the subatomic world as well as the origin of the universe. In space, cosmic rays are subatomic particles that have been accelerated to very high energies in supernovas (exploding massive stars) and active galactic nuclei. It is important to understand the processes that accelerate cosmic rays because these rays contain highly penetrating radiation that can damage electronics flown on spacecraft, for example.\n\nAverage Acceleration\n\nThe formal definition of acceleration is consistent with these notions just described, but is more inclusive.\n\nAverage Acceleration\n\nAverage acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes:\n\n$a\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{{v}_{\\text{f}}â{v}_{0}}{{t}_{\\text{f}}â{t}_{0}},a\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{{v}_{\\text{f}}â{v}_{0}}{{t}_{\\text{f}}â{t}_{0}},$\n\n3.8\n\nwhere\n\n$a\\text{â}a\\text{â}$\n\nis\n\naverage acceleration\n\n,\n\nv\n\nis velocity, and\n\nt\n\nis time. (The bar over the\n\na\n\nmeans\n\naverage\n\nacceleration.)\n\nBecause acceleration is velocity in meters per second divided by time in seconds, the SI units for acceleration are often abbreviated m/s\n\n2\n\nâthat is, meters per second squared or meters per second per second. This literally means by how many meters per second the velocity changes every second. Recall that velocity is a vectorâit has both magnitude and directionâwhich means that a change in velocity can be a change in magnitude (or speed), but it can also be a change in direction. For example, if a runner traveling at 10 km/h due east slows to a stop, reverses direction, and continues her run at 10 km/h due west, her velocity has changed as a result of the change in direction, although the\n\nmagnitude\n\nof the velocity is the same in both directions. Thus, acceleration occurs when velocity changes in magnitude (an increase or decrease in speed) or in direction, or both.\n\nAcceleration as a Vector\n\nAcceleration is a vector in the same direction as the\n\nchange\n\nin velocity,\n\n$\\text{Î}v\\text{Î}v$\n\n. Since velocity is a vector, it can change in magnitude or in direction, or both. Acceleration is, therefore, a change in speed or direction, or both.\n\nKeep in mind that although acceleration is in the direction of the change in velocity, it is not always in the direction of motion. When an object slows down, its acceleration is opposite to the direction of its motion. Although this is commonly referred to as\n\ndeceleration\n\nFigure 3.10\n\n, we say the train is accelerating in a direction opposite to its direction of motion.\n\nFigure\n\n3.10\n\nA subway train in Sao Paulo, Brazil, accelerates opposite to the motion as it comes into a station. It is accelerating in a direction opposite to its direction of motion. (credit: modification of work by Yusuke Kawasaki)\n\nThe term\n\ndeceleration\n\ncan cause confusion in our analysis because it is not a vector and it does not point to a specific direction with respect to a coordinate system, so we do not use it. Acceleration is a vector, so we must choose the appropriate sign for it in our chosen coordinate system. In the case of the train in\n\nFigure 3.10\n\n, acceleration is\n\nin the negative direction in the chosen coordinate system\n\n, so we say the train is undergoing negative acceleration.\n\nIf an object in motion has a velocity in the positive direction with respect to a chosen origin and it acquires a constant negative acceleration, the object eventually comes to a rest and reverses direction. If we wait long enough, the object passes through the origin going in the opposite direction. This is illustrated in\n\nFigure 3.11\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n3.11\n\nAn object in motion with a velocity vector toward the east under negative acceleration comes to a rest and reverses direction. It passes the origin going in the opposite direction after a long enough time.\n\nExample\n\n3.5\n\nCalculating Average Acceleration: A Racehorse Leaves the Gate\n\nA racehorse coming out of the gate accelerates from rest to a velocity of 15.0 m/s due west in 1.80 s. What is its average acceleration?\n\nFigure\n\n3.12\n\nRacehorses accelerating out of the gate. (credit: modification of work by Jon Sullivan)\n\nStrategy\n\nFirst we draw a sketch and assign a coordinate system to the problem\n\nFigure 3.13\n\n. This is a simple problem, but it always helps to visualize it. Notice that we assign east as positive and west as negative. Thus, in this case, we have negative velocity.\n\nFigure\n\n3.13\n\nIdentify the coordinate system, the given information, and what you want to determine.\n\nWe can solve this problem by identifying\n\n$\\text{Î}v\\text{and}\\text{Î}t\\text{Î}v\\text{and}\\text{Î}t$\n\nfrom the given information, and then calculating the average acceleration directly from the equation\n\n$a\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{{v}_{\\text{f}}â{v}_{0}}{{t}_{\\text{f}}â{t}_{0}}a\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{{v}_{\\text{f}}â{v}_{0}}{{t}_{\\text{f}}â{t}_{0}}$\n\n.\n\nSolution\n\nFirst, identify the knowns:\n\n${v}_{0}=0,{v}_{\\text{f}}=â15.0\\text{m/s}{v}_{0}=0,{v}_{\\text{f}}=â15.0\\text{m/s}$\n\n(the negative sign indicates direction toward the west), Î\n\nt\n\n= 1.80 s.\n\nSecond, find the change in velocity. Since the horse is going from zero to â15.0 m/s, its change in velocity equals its final velocity:\n\n$\\text{Î}v={v}_{\\text{f}}â{v}_{0}={v}_{\\text{f}}=â15.0\\text{m/s}.\\text{Î}v={v}_{\\text{f}}â{v}_{0}={v}_{\\text{f}}=â15.0\\text{m/s}.$\n\nLast, substitute the known values (\n\n$\\text{Î}v\\text{and}\\text{Î}t\\text{Î}v\\text{and}\\text{Î}t$\n\n) and solve for the unknown\n\n$a\\text{â}a\\text{â}$\n\n:\n\n$a\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{â15.0\\text{m/s}}{1.80\\text{s}}=â8.33{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.a\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{â15.0\\text{m/s}}{1.80\\text{s}}=â8.33{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.$\n\nSignificance\n\nThe negative sign for acceleration indicates that acceleration is toward the west. An acceleration of 8.33 m/s\n\n2\n\ndue west means the horse increases its velocity by 8.33 m/s due west each second; that is, 8.33 meters per second per second, which we write as 8.33 m/s\n\n2\n\n. This is truly an average acceleration, because the ride is not smooth. We see later that an acceleration of this magnitude would require the rider to hang on with a force nearly equal to his weight.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n3.3\n\nProtons in a linear accelerator are accelerated from rest to\n\n$2.0Ã{10}^{7}\\text{m/s}2.0Ã{10}^{7}\\text{m/s}$\n\nin 10\n\nâ4\n\ns. What is the average acceleration of the protons?\n\nInstantaneous Acceleration\n\nInstantaneous acceleration\n\na\n\n, or\n\nacceleration at a specific instant in time\n\n, is obtained using the same process discussed for instantaneous velocity. That is, we calculate the average acceleration between two points in time separated by\n\n$\\text{Î}t\\text{Î}t$\n\nand let\n\n$\\text{Î}t\\text{Î}t$\n\napproach zero. The result is the derivative of the velocity function\n\nv\n\n(\n\nt\n\n), which is\n\ninstantaneous acceleration\n\nand is expressed mathematically as\n\n$a(t)=\\frac{d}{dt}v(t).a(t)=\\frac{d}{dt}v(t).$\n\n3.9\n\nThus, similar to velocity being the derivative of the position function, instantaneous acceleration is the derivative of the velocity function. We can show this graphically in the same way as instantaneous velocity. In\n\nFigure 3.14\n\n, instantaneous acceleration at time\n\nt\n\n0\n\nis the slope of the tangent line to the velocity-versus-time graph at time\n\nt\n\n0\n\n. We see that average acceleration\n\n$a\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{\\text{Î}t}a\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{\\text{Î}t}$\n\napproaches instantaneous acceleration as\n\n$\\text{Î}t\\text{Î}t$\n\napproaches zero. Also in part (a) of the figure, we see that velocity has a maximum when its slope is zero. This time corresponds to the zero of the acceleration function. In part (b), instantaneous acceleration at the minimum velocity is shown, which is also zero, since the slope of the curve is zero there, too. Thus, for a given velocity function, the zeros of the acceleration function give either the minimum or the maximum velocity.\n\nFigure\n\n3.14\n\nIn a graph of velocity versus time, instantaneous acceleration is the slope of the tangent line. (a) Shown is average acceleration\n\n$a\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{{v}_{\\text{f}}â{v}_{i}}{{t}_{\\text{f}}â{t}_{i}}a\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{\\text{Î}t}=\\frac{{v}_{\\text{f}}â{v}_{i}}{{t}_{\\text{f}}â{t}_{i}}$\n\nbetween times\n\n$\\text{Î}t={t}_{6}â{t}_{1},\\text{Î}t={t}_{5}â{t}_{2}\\text{Î}t={t}_{6}â{t}_{1},\\text{Î}t={t}_{5}â{t}_{2}$\n\n, and\n\n$\\text{Î}t={t}_{4}â{t}_{3}\\text{Î}t={t}_{4}â{t}_{3}$\n\n. When\n\n$\\text{Î}tâ0\\text{Î}tâ0$\n\n, the average acceleration approaches instantaneous acceleration at time\n\nt\n\n0\n\n. In view (a), instantaneous acceleration is shown for the point on the velocity curve at maximum velocity. At this point, instantaneous acceleration is the slope of the tangent line, which is zero. At any other time, the slope of the tangent lineâand thus instantaneous accelerationâwould not be zero. (b) Same as (a) but shown for instantaneous acceleration at minimum velocity.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, letâs look at two examples. First, a simple example is shown using\n\nFigure 3.9\n\n(b), the velocity-versus-time graph of\n\nExample 3.4\n\n, to find acceleration graphically. This graph is depicted in\n\nFigure 3.15\n\n(a), which is a straight line. The corresponding graph of acceleration versus time is found from the slope of velocity and is shown in\n\nFigure 3.15\n\n(b). In this example, the velocity function is a straight line with a constant slope, thus acceleration is a constant. In the next example, the velocity function has a more complicated functional dependence on time.\n\nFigure\n\n3.15\n\n(a, b) The velocity-versus-time graph is linear and has a negative constant slope (a) that is equal to acceleration, shown in (b).\n\nIf we know the functional form of velocity,\n\nv\n\n(\n\nt\n\n), we can calculate instantaneous acceleration\n\na\n\n(\n\nt\n\n) at any time point in the motion using\n\nEquation 3.9\n\n.\n\nExample\n\n3.6\n\nCalculating Instantaneous Acceleration\n\nA particle is in motion and is accelerating. The functional form of the velocity is\n\n$v(t)=(20{\\text{m/s}}^{2})tâ\\text{(5}{\\text{m/s}}^{3}\\text{)}{t}^{2}v(t)=(20{\\text{m/s}}^{2})tâ\\text{(5}{\\text{m/s}}^{3}\\text{)}{t}^{2}$\n\n.\n\nFind the functional form of the acceleration.\n\nFind the instantaneous velocity at\n\nt\n\n= 1, 2, 3, and 5 s.\n\nFind the instantaneous acceleration at\n\nt\n\n= 1, 2, 3, and 5 s.\n\nInterpret the results of (c) in terms of the directions of the acceleration and velocity vectors.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe find the functional form of acceleration by taking the derivative of the velocity function. Then, we calculate the values of instantaneous velocity and acceleration from the given functions for each. For part (d), we need to compare the directions of velocity and acceleration at each time.\n\nSolution\n\n$a(t)=\\frac{dv(t)}{dt}=(20{\\text{m/s}}^{2}\\text{)}â(10{\\text{m/s}}^{3})ta(t)=\\frac{dv(t)}{dt}=(20{\\text{m/s}}^{2}\\text{)}â(10{\\text{m/s}}^{3})t$\n\n$v(1\\text{s})=15\\text{m/s}v(1\\text{s})=15\\text{m/s}$\n\n,\n\n$v(2\\text{s})=20\\text{m/s}v(2\\text{s})=20\\text{m/s}$\n\n,\n\n$v(3\\text{s})=15\\text{m/s}v(3\\text{s})=15\\text{m/s}$\n\n,\n\n$v(5\\text{s})=â25\\text{m/s}v(5\\text{s})=â25\\text{m/s}$\n\n$a(1\\text{s})=10{\\text{m/s}}^{2}a(1\\text{s})=10{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n,\n\n$a(2\\text{s})=0{\\text{m/s}}^{2}a(2\\text{s})=0{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n,\n\n$a(3\\text{s})=â10{\\text{m/s}}^{2}a(3\\text{s})=â10{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n,\n\n$a(5\\text{s})=â30{\\text{m/s}}^{2}a(5\\text{s})=â30{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\nAt\n\nt\n\n= 1 s, velocity\n\n$v(1\\text{s)}=15\\text{m/s}v(1\\text{s)}=15\\text{m/s}$\n\nis positive and acceleration is positive, so both velocity and acceleration are in the same direction. The particle is moving faster.\n\nAt\n\nt\n\n= 2 s, velocity has increased to\n\n$v(2\\text{s)}=20\\text{m/s}v(2\\text{s)}=20\\text{m/s}$\n\n, where it is maximum, which corresponds to the time when the acceleration is zero. We see that the maximum velocity occurs when the slope of the velocity function is zero, which is just the zero of the acceleration function.\n\nAt\n\nt\n\n= 3 s, velocity is\n\n$v(3\\text{s)}=15\\text{m/s}v(3\\text{s)}=15\\text{m/s}$\n\nand acceleration is negative. The particle has reduced its velocity and the acceleration vector is negative. The particle is slowing down.\n\nAt\n\nt\n\n= 5 s, velocity is\n\n$v(5\\text{s)}=â25\\text{m/s}v(5\\text{s)}=â25\\text{m/s}$\n\nand acceleration is increasingly negative. Between the times\n\nt =\n\n3 s and\n\nt\n\n= 5 s the particle has decreased its velocity to zero and then become negative, thus reversing its direction. The particle is now speeding up again, but in the opposite direction.\n\nWe can see these results graphically in\n\nFigure 3.16\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n3.16\n\n(a) Velocity versus time. Tangent lines are indicated at times 1, 2, and 3 s. The slopes of the tangent lines are the accelerations. At\n\nt\n\n= 3 s, velocity is positive. At\n\nt\n\n= 5 s, velocity is negative, indicating the particle has reversed direction. (b) Acceleration versus time. Comparing the values of accelerations given by the black dots with the corresponding slopes of the tangent lines (slopes of lines through black dots) in (a), we see they are identical.\n\nSignificance\n\nBy doing both a numerical and graphical analysis of velocity and acceleration of the particle, we can learn much about its motion. The numerical analysis complements the graphical analysis in giving a total view of the motion. The zero of the acceleration function corresponds to the maximum of the velocity in this example. Also in this example, when acceleration is positive and in the same direction as velocity, velocity increases. As acceleration tends toward zero, eventually becoming negative, the velocity reaches a maximum, after which it starts decreasing. If we wait long enough, velocity also becomes negative, indicating a reversal of direction. A real-world example of this type of motion is a car with a velocity that is increasing to a maximum, after which it starts slowing down, comes to a stop, then reverses direction.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n3.4\n\nAn airplane lands on a runway traveling east. Describe its acceleration.\n\nGetting a Feel for Acceleration\n\nYou are probably used to experiencing acceleration when you step into an elevator, or step on the gas pedal in your car. However, acceleration is happening to many other objects in our universe with which we donât have direct contact.\n\nTable 3.2\n\npresents the acceleration of various objects. We can see the magnitudes of the accelerations extend over many orders of magnitude.\n\nAcceleration\n\nValue (m/s\n\n2\n\n)\n\nHigh-speed train\n\n0.25\n\nElevator\n\n2\n\nCheetah\n\n5\n\nObject in a free fall without air resistance near the surface of Earth\n\n9.8\n\nSpace shuttle maximum during launch\n\n29\n\nParachutist peak during normal opening of parachute\n\n59\n\nF16 aircraft pulling out of a dive\n\n79\n\nExplosive seat ejection from aircraft\n\n147\n\nSprint missile\n\n982\n\nFastest rocket sled peak acceleration\n\n1540\n\nJumping flea\n\n3200\n\nBaseball struck by a bat\n\n30,000\n\nClosing jaws of a trap-jaw ant\n\n1,000,000\n\nProton in the large Hadron collider\n\n$1.9Ã{10}^{9}1.9Ã{10}^{9}$\n\nTable\n\n3.2\n\nTypical Values of Acceleration\n\n(credit: Wikipedia: Orders of Magnitude (acceleration))\n\nIn this table, we see that typical accelerations vary widely with different objects and have nothing to do with object size or how massive it is. Acceleration can also vary widely with time during the motion of an object. A drag racer has a large acceleration just after its start, but then it tapers off as the vehicle reaches a constant velocity. Its average acceleration can be quite different from its instantaneous acceleration at a particular time during its motion.\n\nFigure 3.17\n\ncompares graphically average acceleration with instantaneous acceleration for two very different motions.\n\nFigure\n\n3.17\n\nGraphs of instantaneous acceleration versus time for two different one-dimensional motions. (a) Acceleration varies only slightly and is always in the same direction, since it is positive. The average over the interval is nearly the same as the acceleration at any given time. (b) Acceleration varies greatly, perhaps representing a package on a post office conveyor belt that is accelerated forward and backward as it bumps along. It is necessary to consider small time intervals (such as from 0â1.0 s) with constant or nearly constant acceleration in such a situation.\n\nInteractive\n\nLearn about position, velocity, and acceleration graphs.

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nIdentify which equations of motion are to be used to solve for unknowns.\n\nUse appropriate equations of motion to solve a two-body pursuit problem.\n\nYou might guess that the greater the acceleration of, say, a car moving away from a stop sign, the greater the carâs displacement in a given time. But, we have not developed a specific equation that relates acceleration and displacement. In this section, we look at some convenient equations for kinematic relationships, starting from the definitions of displacement, velocity, and acceleration. We first investigate a single object in motion, called single-body motion. Then we investigate the motion of two objects, called\n\ntwo-body pursuit problems\n\n.\n\nNotation\n\nFirst, let us make some simplifications in notation. Taking the initial time to be zero, as if time is measured with a stopwatch, is a great simplification. Since elapsed time is\n\n$\\text{Î}t={t}_{\\text{f}}â{t}_{0}\\text{Î}t={t}_{\\text{f}}â{t}_{0}$\n\n, taking\n\n${t}_{0}=0{t}_{0}=0$\n\nmeans that\n\n$\\text{Î}t={t}_{\\text{f}}\\text{Î}t={t}_{\\text{f}}$\n\n, the final time on the stopwatch. When initial time is taken to be zero, we use the subscript 0 to denote initial values of position and velocity. That is,\n\n${x}_{0}{x}_{0}$\n\nis the initial position\n\nand\n\n${v}_{0}{v}_{0}$\n\nis the initial velocity\n\n. We put no subscripts on the final values. That is,\n\nt is the final time\n\n,\n\nx is the final position\n\n, and\n\nv is the final velocity\n\n. This gives a simpler expression for elapsed time,\n\n$\\text{Î}t=t\\text{Î}t=t$\n\n. It also simplifies the expression for\n\nx\n\ndisplacement, which is now\n\n$\\text{Î}x=xâ{x}_{0}\\text{Î}x=xâ{x}_{0}$\n\n. Also, it simplifies the expression for change in velocity, which is now\n\n$\\text{Î}v=vâ{v}_{0}\\text{Î}v=vâ{v}_{0}$\n\n. To summarize, using the simplified notation, with the initial time taken to be zero,\n\n$\\text{Î}t=t\\text{Î}x=xâ{x}_{0}\\text{Î}v=vâ{v}_{0},\\text{Î}t=t\\text{Î}x=xâ{x}_{0}\\text{Î}v=vâ{v}_{0},$\n\nwhere the subscript 0 denotes an initial value and the absence of a subscript denotes a final value in whatever motion is under consideration.\n\nWe now make the important assumption that\n\nacceleration is constant\n\n. This assumption allows us to avoid using calculus to find instantaneous acceleration. Since acceleration is constant, the average and instantaneous accelerations are equalâthat is,\n\n$a\\text{â}=a=\\text{constant}\\text{.}a\\text{â}=a=\\text{constant}\\text{.}$\n\nThus, we can use the symbol\n\na\n\nfor acceleration at all times. Assuming acceleration to be constant does not seriously limit the situations we can study nor does it degrade the accuracy of our treatment. For one thing, acceleration\n\nis\n\nconstant in a great number of situations. Furthermore, in many other situations we can describe motion accurately by assuming a constant acceleration equal to the average acceleration for that motion. Lastly, for motion during which acceleration changes drastically, such as a car accelerating to top speed and then braking to a stop, motion can be considered in separate parts, each of which has its own constant acceleration.\n\nDisplacement and Position from Velocity\n\nTo get our first two equations, we start with the definition of average velocity:\n\n$v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}x}{\\text{Î}t}.v\\text{â}=\\frac{\\text{Î}x}{\\text{Î}t}.$\n\nSubstituting the simplified notation for\n\n$\\text{Î}x\\text{Î}x$\n\nand\n\n$\\text{Î}t\\text{Î}t$\n\nyields\n\n$v\\text{â}=\\frac{xâ{x}_{0}}{t}.v\\text{â}=\\frac{xâ{x}_{0}}{t}.$\n\nSolving for\n\nx\n\ngives us\n\n$x={x}_{0}+v\\text{â}t,x={x}_{0}+v\\text{â}t,$\n\n3.10\n\nwhere the average velocity is\n\n$v\\text{â}=\\frac{{v}_{0}+v}{2}.v\\text{â}=\\frac{{v}_{0}+v}{2}.$\n\n3.11\n\nThe equation\n\n$v\\text{â}=\\frac{{v}_{0}+v}{2}v\\text{â}=\\frac{{v}_{0}+v}{2}$\n\nreflects the fact that when acceleration is constant,\n\n$v\\text{â}v\\text{â}$\n\nis just the simple average of the initial and final velocities.\n\nFigure 3.18\n\nillustrates this concept graphically. In part (a) of the figure, acceleration is constant, with velocity increasing at a constant rate. The average velocity during the 1-h interval from 40 km/h to 80 km/h is 60 km/h:\n\n$v\\text{â}=\\frac{{v}_{0}+v}{2}=\\frac{40\\text{km/h}+80\\text{km/h}}{2}=60\\text{km/h}\\text{.}v\\text{â}=\\frac{{v}_{0}+v}{2}=\\frac{40\\text{km/h}+80\\text{km/h}}{2}=60\\text{km/h}\\text{.}$\n\nIn part (b), acceleration is not constant. During the 1-h interval, velocity is closer to 80 km/h than 40 km/h. Thus, the average velocity is greater than in part (a).\n\nFigure\n\n3.18\n\n(a) Velocity-versus-time graph with constant acceleration showing the initial and final velocities\n\n${v}_{0}\\text{and}v{v}_{0}\\text{and}v$\n\n.

What is its final velocity?\n\nStrategy\n\nFirst, we identify the knowns:\n\n${v}_{0}=70\\text{m/s,}a=â1.50{\\text{m/s}}^{2},t=40\\text{s}{v}_{0}=70\\text{m/s,}a=â1.50{\\text{m/s}}^{2},t=40\\text{s}$\n\n.\n\nSecond, we identify the unknown; in this case, it is final velocity\n\n${v}_{\\text{f}}{v}_{\\text{f}}$\n\n.\n\nLast, we determine which equation to use. To do this we figure out which kinematic equation gives the unknown in terms of the knowns. We calculate the final velocity using\n\nEquation 3.12\n\n,\n\n$v={v}_{0}+atv={v}_{0}+at$\n\n.\n\nSolution\n\nSubstitute the known values and solve:\n\n$v={v}_{0}+at=70.0\\text{m/s}+(â1.50\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{2})(40.0 s)=10.0 m/s.v={v}_{0}+at=70.0\\text{m/s}+(â1.50\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{2})(40.0 s)=10.0 m/s.$\n\nFigure 3.19\n\nis a sketch that shows the acceleration and velocity vectors.\n\nFigure\n\n3.19\n\nThe airplane lands with an initial velocity of 70.0 m/s and slows to a final velocity of 10.0 m/s before heading for the terminal. Note the acceleration is negative because its direction is opposite to its velocity, which is positive.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe final velocity is much less than the initial velocity, as desired when slowing down, but is still positive (see figure). With jet engines, reverse thrust can be maintained long enough to stop the plane and start moving it backward, which is indicated by a negative final velocity, but is not the case here.\n\nIn addition to being useful in problem solving, the equation\n\n$v={v}_{0}+atv={v}_{0}+at$\n\ngives us insight into the relationships among velocity, acceleration, and time. We can see, for example, that\n\nFinal velocity depends on how large the acceleration is and how long it lasts\n\nIf the acceleration is zero, then the final velocity equals the initial velocity (\n\nv\n\n=\n\nv\n\n0\n\n), as expected (in other words, velocity is constant)\n\nIf\n\na\n\nis negative, then the final velocity is less than the initial velocity\n\nAll these observations fit our intuition. Note that it is always useful to examine basic equations in light of our intuition and experience to check that they do indeed describe nature accurately.\n\nSolving for Final Position with Constant Acceleration\n\nWe can combine the previous equations to find a third equation that allows us to calculate the final position of an object experiencing constant acceleration. We start with\n\n$v={v}_{0}+at.v={v}_{0}+at.$\n\nAdding\n\n${v}_{0}{v}_{0}$\n\nto each side of this equation and dividing by 2 gives\n\n$\\frac{{v}_{0}+v}{2}={v}_{0}+\\frac{1}{2}at.\\frac{{v}_{0}+v}{2}={v}_{0}+\\frac{1}{2}at.$\n\nSince\n\n$\\frac{{v}_{0}+v}{2}=v\\text{â}\\frac{{v}_{0}+v}{2}=v\\text{â}$\n\nfor constant acceleration, we have\n\n$v\\text{â}={v}_{0}+\\frac{1}{2}at.v\\text{â}={v}_{0}+\\frac{1}{2}at.$\n\nNow we substitute this expression for\n\n$v\\text{â}v\\text{â}$\n\ninto the equation for displacement,\n\n$x={x}_{0}+v\\text{â}tx={x}_{0}+v\\text{â}t$\n\n, yielding\n\n$x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}(\\text{constant}a).x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}(\\text{constant}a).$\n\n3.13\n\nExample\n\n3.8\n\nCalculating Displacement of an Accelerating Object\n\nDragsters can achieve an average acceleration of 26.0 m/s\n\n2\n\n. Suppose a dragster accelerates from rest at this rate for 5.56 s (\n\nFigure 3.20\n\n). How far does it travel in this time?\n\nFigure\n\n3.20\n\nU.S. Army Top Fuel pilot Tony âThe Sargeâ Schumacher begins a race with a controlled burnout. (credit: Lt. Col. William Thurmond. Photo Courtesy of U.S. Army.)\n\nStrategy\n\nFirst, letâs draw a sketch (\n\nFigure 3.21\n\n). We are asked to find displacement, which is\n\nx\n\nif we take\n\n${x}_{0}{x}_{0}$\n\nto be zero. (Think about\n\n${x}_{0}{x}_{0}$\n\nas the starting line of a race. It can be anywhere, but we call it zero and measure all other positions relative to it.) We can use the equation\n\n$x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}$\n\nwhen we identify\n\n${v}_{0}{v}_{0}$\n\n,\n\n$aa$\n\n, and\n\nt\n\nfrom the statement of the problem.\n\nFigure\n\n3.21\n\nSketch of an accelerating dragster.\n\nSolution\n\nFirst, we need to identify the knowns. Starting from rest means that\n\n${v}_{0}=0{v}_{0}=0$\n\n,\n\na\n\nis given as 26.0 m/s\n\n2\n\nand\n\nt\n\nis given as 5.56 s.\n\nSecond, we substitute the known values into the equation to solve for the unknown:\n\n$x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}.x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}.$\n\nSince the initial position and velocity are both zero, this equation simplifies to\n\n$x=\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}.x=\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}.$\n\nSubstituting the identified values of\n\na\n\nand\n\nt\n\ngives\n\n$x=\\frac{1}{2}(26.0{\\text{m/s}}^{2}){(5.56\\text{s})}^{2}=402\\text{m}\\text{.}x=\\frac{1}{2}(26.0{\\text{m/s}}^{2}){(5.56\\text{s})}^{2}=402\\text{m}\\text{.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nIf we convert 402 m to miles, we find that the distance covered is very close to one-quarter of a mile, the standard distance for drag racing. So, our answer is reasonable. This is an impressive displacement to cover in only 5.56 s, but top-notch dragsters can do a quarter mile in even less time than this. If the dragster were given an initial velocity, this would add another term to the distance equation. If the same acceleration and time are used in the equation, the distance covered would be much greater.\n\nWhat else can we learn by examining the equation\n\n$x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}?x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}?$\n\nWe can see the following relationships:\n\nDisplacement depends on the square of the elapsed time when acceleration is not zero. In\n\nExample 3.8\n\n, the dragster covers only one-fourth of the total distance in the first half of the elapsed time.\n\nIf acceleration is zero, then initial velocity equals average velocity\n\n$({v}_{0}=v\\text{â})({v}_{0}=v\\text{â})$\n\n, and\n\n$x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}\\text{becomes}x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t.x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}\\text{becomes}x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t.$\n\nSolving for Final Velocity from Distance and Acceleration\n\nA fourth useful equation can be obtained from another algebraic manipulation of previous equations. If we solve\n\n$v={v}_{0}+atv={v}_{0}+at$\n\nfor\n\nt\n\n, we get\n\n$t=\\frac{vâ{v}_{0}}{a}.t=\\frac{vâ{v}_{0}}{a}.$\n\nSubstituting this and\n\n$v\\text{â}=\\frac{{v}_{0}+v}{2}v\\text{â}=\\frac{{v}_{0}+v}{2}$\n\ninto\n\n$x={x}_{0}+v\\text{â}tx={x}_{0}+v\\text{â}t$\n\n, we get\n\n${v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}+2a(xâ{x}_{0})(\\text{constant}a).{v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}+2a(xâ{x}_{0})(\\text{constant}a).$\n\n3.14\n\nExample\n\n3.9\n\nCalculating Final Velocity\n\nCalculate the final velocity of the dragster in\n\nExample 3.8\n\nwithout using information about time.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe equation\n\n${v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}+2a(xâ{x}_{0}){v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}+2a(xâ{x}_{0})$\n\nis ideally suited to this task because it relates velocities, acceleration, and displacement, and no time information is required.\n\nSolution\n\nFirst, we identify the known values. We know that\n\nv\n\n0\n\n= 0, since the dragster starts from rest. We also know that\n\nx\n\nâ\n\nx\n\n0\n\n= 402 m (this was the answer in\n\nExample 3.8\n\n). The average acceleration was given by\n\na\n\n= 26.0 m/s\n\n2\n\n.\n\nSecond, we substitute the knowns into the equation\n\n${v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}+2a(xâ{x}_{0}){v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}+2a(xâ{x}_{0})$\n\nand solve for\n\nv\n\n:\n\n${v}^{2}=0+2(26.0{\\text{m/s}}^{2})(402\\text{m}).{v}^{2}=0+2(26.0{\\text{m/s}}^{2})(402\\text{m}).$\n\nThus,\n\n${v}^{2}=2.09Ã{10}^{4}{\\text{m}}^{2}{\\text{/s}}^{2}v=\\sqrt{2.09Ã{10}^{4}{\\text{m}}^{2}{\\text{/s}}^{2}}=145\\text{m/s}\\text{.}{v}^{2}=2.09Ã{10}^{4}{\\text{m}}^{2}{\\text{/s}}^{2}v=\\sqrt{2.09Ã{10}^{4}{\\text{m}}^{2}{\\text{/s}}^{2}}=145\\text{m/s}\\text{.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nA velocity of 145 m/s is about 522 km/h, or about 324 mi/h, but even this breakneck speed is short of the record for the quarter mile. Also, note that a square root has two values; we took the positive value to indicate a velocity in the same direction as the acceleration.\n\nAn examination of the equation\n\n${v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}+2a(xâ{x}_{0}){v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}+2a(xâ{x}_{0})$\n\ncan produce additional insights into the general relationships among physical quantities:\n\nThe final velocity depends on how large the acceleration is and the distance over which it acts.\n\nFor a fixed acceleration, a car that is going twice as fast doesnât simply stop in twice the distance. It takes much farther to stop. (This is why we have reduced speed zones near schools.)\n\nPutting Equations Together\n\nIn the following examples, we continue to explore one-dimensional motion, but in situations requiring slightly more algebraic manipulation. The examples also give insight into problem-solving techniques. The note that follows is provided for easy reference to the equations needed. Be aware that these equations are not independent. In many situations we have two unknowns and need two equations from the set to solve for the unknowns. We need as many equations as there are unknowns to solve a given situation.\n\nSummary of Kinematic Equations (constant\n\na\n\n)\n\n$x={x}_{0}+v\\text{â}tx={x}_{0}+v\\text{â}t$\n\n$v\\text{â}=\\frac{{v}_{0}+v}{2}v\\text{â}=\\frac{{v}_{0}+v}{2}$\n\n$v={v}_{0}+atv={v}_{0}+at$\n\n$x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}$\n\n${v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}+2a(xâ{x}_{0}){v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}+2a(xâ{x}_{0})$\n\nBefore we get into the examples, letâs look at some of the equations more closely to see the behavior of acceleration at extreme values. Rearranging\n\nEquation 3.12\n\n, we have\n\n$a=\\frac{vâ{v}_{0}}{t}.a=\\frac{vâ{v}_{0}}{t}.$\n\nFrom this we see that, for a finite time, if the difference between the initial and final velocities is small, the acceleration is small, approaching zero in the limit that the initial and final velocities are equal. On the contrary, in the limit\n\n$tâ0tâ0$\n\nfor a finite difference between the initial and final velocities, acceleration becomes infinite.\n\nSimilarly, rearranging\n\nEquation 3.14\n\n, we can express acceleration in terms of velocities and displacement:\n\n$a=\\frac{{v}^{2}â{v}_{0}^{2}}{2(xâ{x}_{0})}.a=\\frac{{v}^{2}â{v}_{0}^{2}}{2(xâ{x}_{0})}.$\n\nThus, for a finite difference between the initial and final velocities acceleration becomes infinite in the limit the displacement approaches zero. Acceleration approaches zero in the limit the difference in initial and final velocities approaches zero for a finite displacement.\n\nExample\n\n3.10\n\nHow Far Does a Car Go?\n\nOn dry concrete, a car can accelerate opposite to the motion at a rate of 7.00 m/s\n\n2\n\n, whereas on wet concrete it can accelerate opposite to the motion at only 5.00 m/s\n\n2\n\n. Find the distances necessary to stop a car moving at 30.0 m/s (about 110 km/h) on (a) dry concrete and (b) wet concrete. (c) Repeat both calculations and find the displacement from the point where the driver sees a traffic light turn red, taking into account their reaction time of 0.500 s to get their foot on the brake.\n\nStrategy\n\nFirst, we need to draw a sketch\n\nFigure 3.22\n\n. To determine which equations are best to use, we need to list all the known values and identify exactly what we need to solve for.\n\nFigure\n\n3.22\n\nSample sketch to visualize acceleration opposite to the motion and stopping distance of a car.\n\nSolution\n\nFirst, we need to identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that\n\nv\n\n0\n\n= 30.0 m/s,\n\nv\n\n= 0, and\n\na\n\n= â7.00 m/s\n\n2\n\n(\n\na\n\nis negative because it is in a direction opposite to velocity). We take\n\nx\n\n0\n\nto be zero. We are looking for displacement\n\n$\\text{Î}x\\text{Î}x$\n\n, or\n\nx\n\nâ\n\nx\n\n0\n\n.\n\nSecond, we identify the equation that will help us solve the problem. The best equation to use is\n\n${v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}+2a(xâ{x}_{0}).{v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}+2a(xâ{x}_{0}).$\n\nThis equation is best because it includes only one unknown,\n\nx\n\n. We know the values of all the other variables in this equation. (Other equations would allow us to solve for\n\nx\n\n, but they require us to know the stopping time,\n\nt\n\n, which we do not know. We could use them, but it would entail additional calculations.)\n\nThird, we rearrange the equation to solve for\n\nx\n\n:\n\n$xâ{x}_{0}=\\frac{{v}^{2}â{v}_{0}^{2}}{2a}xâ{x}_{0}=\\frac{{v}^{2}â{v}_{0}^{2}}{2a}$\n\nand substitute the known values:\n\n$xâ0=\\frac{{0}^{2}â{(30.0\\text{m/s})}^{2}}{2(â7.00{\\text{m/s}}^{2})}.xâ0=\\frac{{0}^{2}â{(30.0\\text{m/s})}^{2}}{2(â7.00{\\text{m/s}}^{2})}.$\n\nThus,\n\n$x=64.3\\text{m on dry concrete}\\text{.}x=64.3\\text{m on dry concrete}\\text{.}$\n\nThis part can be solved in exactly the same manner as (a). The only difference is that the acceleration is â5.00 m/s\n\n2\n\n. The result is\n\n${x}_{\\text{wet}}=90.0\\text{m on wet concrete.}{x}_{\\text{wet}}=90.0\\text{m on wet concrete.}$\n\nWhen the driver reacts, the stopping distance is the same as it is in (a) and (b) for dry and wet concrete. So, to answer this question, we need to calculate how far the car travels during the reaction time, and then add that to the stopping time. It is reasonable to assume the velocity remains constant during the driverâs reaction time.\n\nTo do this, we, again, identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that\n\n$v\\text{â}=30.0\\text{m/s}v\\text{â}=30.0\\text{m/s}$\n\n,\n\n${t}_{\\text{reaction}}=0.500\\text{s}{t}_{\\text{reaction}}=0.500\\text{s}$\n\n, and\n\n${a}_{\\text{reaction}}=0{a}_{\\text{reaction}}=0$\n\n. We take\n\n${x}_{\\text{0-reaction}}{x}_{\\text{0-reaction}}$\n\nto be zero. We are looking for\n\n${x}_{\\text{reaction}}{x}_{\\text{reaction}}$\n\n.\n\nSecond, as before, we identify the best equation to use. In this case,\n\n$x={x}_{0}+v\\text{â}tx={x}_{0}+v\\text{â}t$\n\nworks well because the only unknown value is\n\nx\n\n, which is what we want to solve for.\n\nThird, we substitute the knowns to solve the equation:\n\n$x=0+(30.0\\text{m/s})(0.500\\text{s})=15.0\\text{m}.x=0+(30.0\\text{m/s})(0.500\\text{s})=15.0\\text{m}.$\n\nThis means the car travels 15.0 m while the driver reacts, making the total displacements in the two cases of dry and wet concrete 15.0 m greater than if he reacted instantly.\n\nLast, we then add the displacement during the reaction time to the displacement when braking (\n\nFigure 3.23\n\n),\n\n${x}_{\\text{braking}}+{x}_{\\text{reaction}}={x}_{\\text{total}},{x}_{\\text{braking}}+{x}_{\\text{reaction}}={x}_{\\text{total}},$\n\nand find (a) to be 64.3 m + 15.0 m = 79.3 m when dry and (b) to be 90.0 m + 15.0 m = 105 m when wet.\n\nFigure\n\n3.23\n\nThe distance necessary to stop a car varies greatly, depending on road conditions and driver reaction time. Shown here are the braking distances for dry and wet pavement, as calculated in this example, for a car traveling initially at 30.0 m/s. Also shown are the total distances traveled from the point when the driver first sees a light turn red, assuming a 0.500-s reaction time.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe displacements found in this example seem reasonable for stopping a fast-moving car. It should take longer to stop a car on wet pavement than dry. It is interesting that reaction time adds significantly to the displacements, but more important is the general approach to solving problems. We identify the knowns and the quantities to be determined, then find an appropriate equation. If there is more than one unknown, we need as many independent equations as there are unknowns to solve. There is often more than one way to solve a problem. The various parts of this example can, in fact, be solved by other methods, but the solutions presented here are the shortest.\n\nExample\n\n3.11\n\nCalculating Time\n\nSuppose a car merges into freeway traffic on a 200-m-long ramp. If its initial velocity is 10.0 m/s and it accelerates at 2.00 m/s\n\n2\n\n, how long does it take the car to travel the 200 m up the ramp? (Such information might be useful to a traffic engineer.)\n\nStrategy\n\nFirst, we draw a sketch\n\nFigure 3.24\n\n. We are asked to solve for time\n\nt\n\n. As before, we identify the known quantities to choose a convenient physical relationship (that is, an equation with one unknown,\n\nt\n\n.)\n\nFigure\n\n3.24\n\nSketch of a car accelerating on a freeway ramp.\n\nSolution\n\nAgain, we identify the knowns and what we want to solve for. We know that\n\n${x}_{0}=0,{x}_{0}=0,$\n\n${v}_{0}=10\\text{m/s},a=2.00\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{2}{v}_{0}=10\\text{m/s},a=2.00\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{2}$\n\n, and\n\nx\n\n= 200 m.\n\nWe need to solve for\n\nt\n\n. The equation\n\n$x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}$\n\nworks best because the only unknown in the equation is the variable\n\nt\n\n, for which we need to solve. From this insight we see that when we input the knowns into the equation, we end up with a quadratic equation.\n\nWe need to rearrange the equation to solve for\n\nt\n\n, then substituting the knowns into the equation:\n\n$200\\text{m}=0\\text{m}+(10.0\\text{m/s})t+\\frac{1}{2}(2.00{\\text{m/s}}^{2}){t}^{2}.200\\text{m}=0\\text{m}+(10.0\\text{m/s})t+\\frac{1}{2}(2.00{\\text{m/s}}^{2}){t}^{2}.$\n\nWe then simplify the equation. The units of meters cancel because they are in each term. We can get the units of seconds to cancel by taking\n\nt\n\n=\n\nt\n\ns, where\n\nt\n\nis the magnitude of time and s is the unit. Doing so leaves\n\n$200=10t+{t}^{2}.200=10t+{t}^{2}.$\n\nWe then use the quadratic formula to solve for\n\nt\n\n,\n\n${t}^{2}+10tâ200=0t=\\frac{\\text{â}bÂ±\\sqrt{{b}^{2}â4ac}}{2a},{t}^{2}+10tâ200=0t=\\frac{\\text{â}bÂ±\\sqrt{{b}^{2}â4ac}}{2a},$\n\nwhich yields two solutions:\n\nt\n\n= 10.0 and\n\nt\n\n= â20.0. A negative value for time is unreasonable, since it would mean the event happened 20 s before the motion began. We can discard that solution. Thus,\n\n$t=10.0\\text{s}\\text{.}t=10.0\\text{s}\\text{.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nWhenever an equation contains an unknown squared, there are two solutions. In some problems both solutions are meaningful; in others, only one solution is reasonable. The 10.0-s answer seems reasonable for a typical freeway on-ramp.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n3.5\n\nA rocket accelerates at a rate of 20 m/s\n\n2\n\nduring launch. How long does it take the rocket to reach a velocity of 400 m/s?\n\nExample\n\n3.12\n\nAcceleration of a Spaceship\n\nA spaceship has left Earthâs orbit and is on its way to the Moon. It accelerates at 20 m/s\n\n2\n\nfor 2 min and covers a distance of 1000 km. What are the initial and final velocities of the spaceship?\n\nStrategy\n\nWe are asked to find the initial and final velocities of the spaceship. Looking at the kinematic equations, we see that one equation will not give the answer. We must use one kinematic equation to solve for one of the velocities and substitute it into another kinematic equation to get the second velocity. Thus, we solve two of the kinematic equations simultaneously.\n\nSolution\n\nFirst we solve for\n\n${v}_{0}{v}_{0}$\n\nusing\n\n$x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}:x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}:$\n\n$xâ{x}_{0}={v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}xâ{x}_{0}={v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}$\n\n$1.0Ã{10}^{6}\\text{m}={v}_{0}(120.0\\text{s})+\\frac{1}{2}(20.0{\\text{m/s}}^{2}){(120.0\\text{s})}^{2}1.0Ã{10}^{6}\\text{m}={v}_{0}(120.0\\text{s})+\\frac{1}{2}(20.0{\\text{m/s}}^{2}){(120.0\\text{s})}^{2}$\n\n${v}_{0}=7133.3\\text{m/s}\\text{.}{v}_{0}=7133.3\\text{m/s}\\text{.}$\n\nThen we substitute\n\n${v}_{0}{v}_{0}$\n\ninto\n\n$v={v}_{0}+atv={v}_{0}+at$\n\nto solve for the final velocity:\n\n$v={v}_{0}+at=7133.3\\text{m/s}+(20.0{\\text{m/s}}^{2})(120.0\\text{s})=9533.3\\text{m/s.}v={v}_{0}+at=7133.3\\text{m/s}+(20.0{\\text{m/s}}^{2})(120.0\\text{s})=9533.3\\text{m/s.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nThere are six variables in displacement, time, velocity, and acceleration that describe motion in one dimension. The initial conditions of a given problem can be many combinations of these variables. Because of this diversity, solutions may not be as easy as simple substitutions into one of the equations. This example illustrates that solutions to kinematics may require solving two simultaneous kinematic equations.\n\nWith the basics of kinematics established, we can go on to many other interesting examples and applications. In the process of developing kinematics, we have also glimpsed a general approach to problem solving that produces both correct answers and insights into physical relationships. The next level of complexity in our kinematics problems involves the motion of two interrelated bodies, called\n\ntwo-body pursuit problems\n\n.\n\nTwo-Body Pursuit Problems\n\nUp until this point we have looked at examples of motion involving a single body. Even for the problem with two cars and the stopping distances on wet and dry roads, we divided this problem into two separate problems to find the answers. In a\n\ntwo-body pursuit problem\n\n, the motions of the objects are coupledâmeaning, the unknown we seek depends on the motion of both objects. To solve these problems we write the equations of motion for each object and then solve them simultaneously to find the unknown. This is illustrated in\n\nFigure 3.25\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n3.25\n\nA two-body pursuit scenario where car 2 has a constant velocity and car 1 is behind with a constant acceleration. Car 1 catches up with car 2 at a later time.\n\nThe time and distance required for car 1 to catch car 2 depends on the initial distance car 1 is from car 2 as well as the velocities of both cars and the acceleration of car 1. The kinematic equations describing the motion of both cars must be solved to find these unknowns.\n\nConsider the following example.\n\nExample\n\n3.13\n\nCheetah Catching a Gazelle\n\nA cheetah waits in hiding behind a bush. The cheetah spots a gazelle running past at 10 m/s. At the instant the gazelle passes the cheetah, the cheetah accelerates from rest at 4 m/s\n\n2\n\nto catch the gazelle. (a) How long does it take the cheetah to catch the gazelle? (b) What is the displacement of the gazelle and cheetah?\n\nStrategy\n\nWe use the set of equations for constant acceleration to solve this problem. Since there are two objects in motion, we have separate equations of motion describing each animal. But what links the equations is a common parameter that has the same value for each animal. If we look at the problem closely, it is clear the common parameter to each animal is their position\n\nx\n\nat a later time\n\nt\n\n. Since they both start at\n\n${x}_{0}=0{x}_{0}=0$\n\n, their displacements are the same at a later time\n\nt\n\n, when the cheetah catches up with the gazelle. If we pick the equation of motion that solves for the displacement for each animal, we can then set the equations equal to each other and solve for the unknown, which is time.\n\nSolution\n\nEquation for the gazelle: The gazelle has a constant velocity, which is its average velocity, since it is not accelerating. Therefore, we use\n\nEquation 3.10\n\nwith\n\n${x}_{0}=0{x}_{0}=0$\n\n:\n\n$x={x}_{0}+v\\text{â}t=v\\text{â}t.x={x}_{0}+v\\text{â}t=v\\text{â}t.$\n\nEquation for the cheetah: The cheetah is accelerating from rest, so we use\n\nEquation 3.13\n\nwith\n\n${x}_{0}=0{x}_{0}=0$\n\nand\n\n${v}_{0}=0{v}_{0}=0$\n\n:\n\n$x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}.x={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}.$\n\nNow we have an equation of motion for each animal with a common parameter, which can be eliminated to find the solution. In this case, we solve for\n\nt\n\n:\n\n$x=v\\text{â}t=\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}t=\\frac{2v\\text{â}}{a}.x=v\\text{â}t=\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}t=\\frac{2v\\text{â}}{a}.$\n\nThe gazelle has a constant velocity of 10 m/s, which is its average velocity. The acceleration of the cheetah is 4 m/s\n\n2\n\n. Evaluating\n\nt\n\n, the time for the cheetah to reach the gazelle, we have\n\n$t=\\frac{2v\\text{â}}{a}=\\frac{2(10 m/s)}{4{\\text{m/s}}^{2}}=5\\text{s}\\text{.}t=\\frac{2v\\text{â}}{a}=\\frac{2(10 m/s)}{4{\\text{m/s}}^{2}}=5\\text{s}\\text{.}$\n\nTo get the displacement, we use either the equation of motion for the cheetah or the gazelle, since they should both give the same answer.\n\nDisplacement of the cheetah:\n\n$x=\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}(4{\\text{m/s}}^{2}){(5)}^{2}=50\\text{m}\\text{.}x=\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}(4{\\text{m/s}}^{2}){(5)}^{2}=50\\text{m}\\text{.}$\n\nDisplacement of the gazelle:\n\n$x=v\\text{â}t=10 m/s(5)=50\\text{m}\\text{.}x=v\\text{â}t=10 m/s(5)=50\\text{m}\\text{.}$\n\nWe see that both displacements are equal, as expected.\n\nSignificance\n\nIt is important to analyze the motion of each object and to use the appropriate kinematic equations to describe the individual motion. It is also important to have a good visual perspective of the two-body pursuit problem to see the common parameter that links the motion of both objects.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n3.6\n\nA bicycle has a constant velocity of 10 m/s. A person starts from rest and begins to run to catch up to the bicycle in 30 s when the bicycle is at the same position as the person. What is the acceleration of the person?"

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nUse the kinematic equations with the variables y and g to analyze free-fall motion.\n\nDescribe how the values of the position, velocity, and acceleration change during a free fall.\n\nSolve for the position, velocity, and acceleration as functions of time when an object is in a free fall.\n\nAn interesting application of\n\nEquation 3.4\n\nthrough\n\nEquation 3.14\n\nis called\n\nfree fall\n\n, which describes the motion of an object falling in a gravitational field, such as near the surface of Earth or other celestial objects of planetary size. Letâs assume the body is falling in a straight line perpendicular to the surface, so its motion is one-dimensional. For example, we can estimate the depth of a vertical mine shaft by dropping a rock into it and listening for the rock to hit the bottom. But âfalling,â in the context of free fall, does not necessarily imply the body is moving from a greater height to a lesser height. If a ball is thrown upward, the equations of free fall apply equally to its ascent as well as its descent.\n\nGravity\n\nThe most remarkable and unexpected fact about falling objects is that if air resistance and friction are negligible, then in a given location all objects fall toward the center of Earth with the\n\nsame constant acceleration\n\n,\n\nindependent of their mass\n\n. This experimentally determined fact is unexpected because we are so accustomed to the effects of air resistance and friction that we expect light objects to fall slower than heavy ones. Until\n\nGalileo\n\nGalilei (1564â1642) proved otherwise, people believed that a heavier object has a greater acceleration in a free fall. We now know this is not the case. In the absence of air resistance, heavy objects arrive at the ground at the same time as lighter objects when dropped from the same height\n\nFigure 3.26\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n3.26\n\nA hammer and a feather fall with the same constant acceleration if air resistance is negligible. This is a general characteristic of gravity not unique to Earth, as astronaut David R. Scott demonstrated in 1971 on the Moon, where the acceleration from gravity is only 1.67 m/s\n\n2\n\nand there is no atmosphere.\n\nIn the real world,\n\nair resistance\n\ncan cause a lighter object to fall slower than a heavier object of the same size. A tennis ball reaches the ground after a baseball dropped at the same time. (It might be difficult to observe the difference if the height is not large.) Air resistance opposes the motion of an object through the air, and friction between objectsâsuch as between clothes and a laundry chute or between a stone and a pool into which it is droppedâalso opposes motion between them.\n\nFor the ideal situations of these first few chapters, an object\n\nfalling without air resistance or friction\n\nis defined to be in\n\nfree fall\n\n. The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth. The acceleration of free-falling objects is therefore called\n\nacceleration due to gravity\n\n. Acceleration due to gravity is constant, which means we can apply the kinematic equations to any falling object where air resistance and friction are negligible. This opens to us a broad class of interesting situations.\n\nAcceleration due to gravity is so important that its magnitude is given its own symbol,\n\ng\n\n. It is constant at any given location on Earth and has the average value\n\n$g=9.81{\\text{m/s}}^{2}(\\text{or}32.2{\\text{ft/s}}^{2}).g=9.81{\\text{m/s}}^{2}(\\text{or}32.2{\\text{ft/s}}^{2}).$\n\nAlthough\n\ng\n\nvaries from 9.78 m/s\n\n2\n\nto 9.83 m/s\n\n2\n\n, depending on latitude, altitude, underlying geological formations, and local topography, letâs use an average value of 9.8 m/s\n\n2\n\nrounded to two significant figures in this text unless specified otherwise. Neglecting these effects on the value of\n\ng\n\nas a result of position on Earthâs surface, as well as effects resulting from Earthâs rotation, we take the direction of acceleration due to gravity to be downward (toward the center of Earth). In fact, its direction\n\ndefines\n\nwhat we call vertical. Note that whether acceleration\n\na\n\nin the kinematic equations has the value +\n\ng\n\nor â\n\ng\n\ndepends on how we define our coordinate system. If we define the upward direction as positive, then\n\n$a=\\text{â}g=â9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2},a=\\text{â}g=â9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2},$\n\nand if we define the downward direction as positive, then\n\n$a=g=9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2}a=g=9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n.\n\nOne-Dimensional Motion Involving Gravity\n\nThe best way to see the basic features of motion involving gravity is to start with the simplest situations and then progress toward more complex ones. So, we start by considering straight up-and-down motion with no air resistance or friction. These assumptions mean the velocity (if there is any) is vertical. If an object is dropped, we know the initial velocity is zero when in free fall. When the object has left contact with whatever held or threw it, the object is in free fall. When the object is thrown, it has the same initial speed in free fall as it did before it was released. When the object comes in contact with the ground or any other object, it is no longer in free fall and its acceleration of\n\ng\n\nis no longer valid. Under these circumstances, the motion is one-dimensional and has constant acceleration of magnitude\n\ng\n\n. We represent vertical displacement with the symbol\n\ny\n\n.\n\nKinematic Equations for Objects in Free Fall\n\nWe assume here that acceleration equals â\n\ng\n\n(with the positive direction upward).\n\n$v=\\text{â}{v}_{0}âgtv=\\text{â}{v}_{0}âgt$\n\n3.15\n\n$y={y}_{0}+{v}_{0}tâ\\frac{1}{2}g{t}^{2}y={y}_{0}+{v}_{0}tâ\\frac{1}{2}g{t}^{2}$\n\n3.16\n\n${v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}â2g(yâ{y}_{0}){v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}â2g(yâ{y}_{0})$\n\n3.17\n\nProblem-Solving Strategy\n\nFree Fall\n\nDecide on the sign of the acceleration of gravity. In\n\nEquation 3.15\n\nthrough\n\nEquation 3.17\n\n, acceleration\n\ng\n\nis negative, which says the positive direction is upward and the negative direction is downward. In some problems, it may be useful to have acceleration\n\ng\n\nas positive, indicating the positive direction is downward.\n\nDraw a sketch of the problem. This helps visualize the physics involved.\n\nRecord the knowns and unknowns from the problem description. This helps devise a strategy for selecting the appropriate equations to solve the problem.\n\nDecide which of\n\nEquation 3.15\n\nthrough\n\nEquation 3.17\n\nare to be used to solve for the unknowns.\n\nExample\n\n3.14\n\nFree Fall of a Ball\n\nFigure 3.27\n\nshows the positions of a ball, at 1-s intervals, with an initial velocity of 4.9 m/s downward, that is thrown from the top of a 98-m-high building. (a) How much time elapses before the ball reaches the ground? (b) What is the velocity when it arrives at the ground?\n\nFigure\n\n3.27\n\nThe positions and velocities at 1-s intervals of a ball thrown downward from a tall building at 4.9 m/s.\n\nStrategy\n\nChoose the origin at the top of the building with the positive direction upward and the negative direction downward. To find the time when the position is â98 m, we use\n\nEquation 3.16\n\n, with\n\n${y}_{0}=0,{v}_{0}=â4.9\\text{m/s,}\\text{and}g=9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2}{y}_{0}=0,{v}_{0}=â4.9\\text{m/s,}\\text{and}g=9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n.\n\nSolution\n\nSubstitute the given values into the equation:\n\n$y={y}_{0}+{v}_{0}tâ\\frac{1}{2}g{t}^{2}â98.0\\text{m}=0â(4.9\\text{m/s})tâ\\frac{1}{2}(9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2}){t}^{2}.y={y}_{0}+{v}_{0}tâ\\frac{1}{2}g{t}^{2}â98.0\\text{m}=0â(4.9\\text{m/s})tâ\\frac{1}{2}(9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2}){t}^{2}.$\n\nThis simplifies to\n\n${t}^{2}+tâ20=0.{t}^{2}+tâ20=0.$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation with roots\n\n$t=â5.0s\\text{and}t=4.0st=â5.0s\\text{and}t=4.0s$\n\n. The positive root is the one we are interested in, since time\n\n$t=0t=0$\n\nis the time when the ball is released at the top of the building. (The time\n\n$t=â5.0st=â5.0s$\n\nrepresents the fact that a ball thrown upward from the ground would have been in the air for 5.0 s when it passed by the top of the building moving downward at 4.9 m/s.)\n\nUsing\n\nEquation 3.15\n\n, we have\n\n$v={v}_{0}âgt=â4.9\\text{m/s}â(9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2})(4.0\\text{s})=â44.1\\text{m/s}\\text{.}v={v}_{0}âgt=â4.9\\text{m/s}â(9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2})(4.0\\text{s})=â44.1\\text{m/s}\\text{.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nFor situations when two roots are obtained from a quadratic equation in the time variable, we must look at the physical significance of both roots to determine which is correct. Since\n\n$t=0t=0$\n\ncorresponds to the time when the ball was released, the negative root would correspond to a time before the ball was released, which is not physically meaningful. When the ball hits the ground, its velocity is not immediately zero, but as soon as the ball interacts with the ground, its acceleration is not\n\ng\n\nand it accelerates with a different value over a short time to zero velocity. This problem shows how important it is to establish the correct coordinate system and to keep the signs of\n\ng\n\nin the kinematic equations consistent.\n\nExample\n\n3.15\n\nVertical Motion of a Baseball\n\nA batter hits a baseball straight upward at home plate and the ball is caught 5.0 s after it is struck (\n\nFigure 3.28\n\n).

Since the ball rises for 2.5 s, the time to fall is 2.5 s.\n\nThe acceleration is 9.8 m/s\n\n2\n\neverywhere, even when the velocity is zero at the top of the path. Although the velocity is zero at the top, it is changing at the rate of 9.8 m/s\n\n2\n\ndownward.\n\nThe velocity at\n\n$t=5.0st=5.0s$\n\ncan be determined with\n\nEquation 3.15\n\n:\n\n$v={v}_{0}âgt=24.5\\text{m/s}â9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2}(5.0\\text{s})=â24.5\\text{m/s}.v={v}_{0}âgt=24.5\\text{m/s}â9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2}(5.0\\text{s})=â24.5\\text{m/s}.$\n\nSignificance\n\nThe ball returns with the speed it had when it left. This is a general property of free fall for any initial velocity. We used a single equation to go from throw to catch, and did not have to break the motion into two segments, upward and downward. We are used to thinking that the effect of gravity is to create free fall downward toward Earth. It is important to understand, as illustrated in this example, that objects moving upward away from Earth are also in a state of free fall.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n3.7\n\nA chunk of ice breaks off a glacier and falls 30.0 m before it hits the water. Assuming it falls freely (there is no air resistance), how long does it take to hit the water? Which quantity increases faster, the speed of the ice chunk or its distance traveled?\n\nExample\n\n3.16\n\nRocket Booster\n\nA small rocket with a booster blasts off and heads straight upward. When at a height of\n\n$5.0\\text{km}5.0\\text{km}$\n\nand velocity of 200.0 m/s, it releases its booster. (a) What is the maximum height the booster attains? (b) What is the velocity of the booster at a height of 6.0 km? Neglect air resistance.\n\nFigure\n\n3.29\n\nA rocket releases its booster at a given height and velocity. How high and how fast does the booster go?\n\nStrategy\n\nWe need to select the coordinate system for the acceleration of gravity, which we take as negative downward. We are given the initial velocity of the booster and its height. We consider the point of release as the origin. We know the velocity is zero at the maximum position within the acceleration interval; thus, the velocity of the booster is zero at its maximum height, so we can use this information as well. From these observations, we use\n\nEquation 3.17\n\n, which gives us the maximum height of the booster. We also use\n\nEquation 3.17\n\nto give the velocity at 6.0 km. The initial velocity of the booster is 200.0 m/s.\n\nSolution\n\nFrom\n\nEquation 3.17\n\n,\n\n${v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}â2g(yâ{y}_{0}){v}^{2}={v}_{0}^{2}â2g(yâ{y}_{0})$\n\n. With\n\n$v=0\\text{and}{y}_{0}=0v=0\\text{and}{y}_{0}=0$\n\n, we can solve for\n\ny\n\n:\n\n$y=\\frac{{v}_{0}^{2}}{2g}=\\frac{(2.0Ã{10}^{2}\\text{m}\\text{/}{\\text{s})}^{2}}{2(9.8\\text{m}\\text{/}{\\text{s}}^{2})}=2040.8\\text{m}\\text{.}y=\\frac{{v}_{0}^{2}}{2g}=\\frac{(2.0Ã{10}^{2}\\text{m}\\text{/}{\\text{s})}^{2}}{2(9.8\\text{m}\\text{/}{\\text{s}}^{2})}=2040.8\\text{m}\\text{.}$\n\nThis solution gives the maximum height of the booster in our coordinate system, which has its origin at the point of release, so the maximum height of the booster is roughly 7.0 km.\n\nAn altitude of 6.0 km corresponds to\n\n$y=1.0Ã{10}^{3}\\text{m}y=1.0Ã{10}^{3}\\text{m}$\n\nin the coordinate system we are using.

Since our coordinate system has the positive direction upward, the +142.8 m/s corresponds to a positive upward velocity at 6000 m during the upward leg of the trajectory of the booster. The value\n\nv\n\n= â142.8 m/s corresponds to the velocity at 6000 m on the downward leg. This example is also important in that an object is given an initial velocity at the origin of our coordinate system, but the origin is at an altitude above the surface of Earth, which must be taken into account when forming the solution.\n\nInteractive\n\nEngage the Phet simulation below to learn about graphing polynomials.

Using integral calculus, we can work backward and calculate the velocity function from the acceleration function, and the position function from the velocity function.\n\nKinematic Equations from Integral Calculus\n\nLetâs begin with a particle with an acceleration\n\na\n\n(t) which is a known function of time. Since the time derivative of the velocity function is acceleration,\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt}v(t)=a(t),\\frac{d}{dt}v(t)=a(t),$\n\nwe can take the indefinite integral of both sides, finding\n\n$â«\\frac{d}{dt}v(t)dt=â«a(t)dt+{C}_{1},â«\\frac{d}{dt}v(t)dt=â«a(t)dt+{C}_{1},$\n\nwhere\n\nC\n\n1\n\nis a constant of integration. Since\n\n$â«\\frac{d}{dt}v(t)dt=v(t)â«\\frac{d}{dt}v(t)dt=v(t)$\n\n, the velocity is given by\n\n$v(t)=â«a(t)dt+{C}_{1}.v(t)=â«a(t)dt+{C}_{1}.$\n\n3.18\n\nSimilarly, the time derivative of the position function is the velocity function,\n\n$\\frac{d}{dt}x(t)=v(t).\\frac{d}{dt}x(t)=v(t).$\n\nThus, we can use the same mathematical manipulations we just used and find\n\n$x(t)=â«v(t)dt+{C}_{2},x(t)=â«v(t)dt+{C}_{2},$\n\n3.19\n\nwhere\n\nC\n\n2\n\nis a second constant of integration.\n\nWe can derive the kinematic equations for a constant acceleration using these integrals. With\n\na\n\n(\n\nt\n\n) =\n\na\n\na constant, and doing the integration in\n\nEquation 3.18\n\n, we find\n\n$v(t)=â«adt+{C}_{1}=at+{C}_{1}.v(t)=â«adt+{C}_{1}=at+{C}_{1}.$\n\nIf the initial velocity is\n\nv\n\n(0) =\n\nv\n\n0\n\n, then\n\n${v}_{0}=0+{C}_{1}.{v}_{0}=0+{C}_{1}.$\n\nThen,\n\nC\n\n1\n\n=\n\nv\n\n0\n\nand\n\n$v(t)={v}_{0}+at,v(t)={v}_{0}+at,$\n\nwhich is\n\nEquation 3.12\n\n. Substituting this expression into\n\nEquation 3.19\n\ngives\n\n$x(t)=â«({v}_{0}+at)dt+{C}_{2}.x(t)=â«({v}_{0}+at)dt+{C}_{2}.$\n\nDoing the integration, we find\n\n$x(t)={v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}+{C}_{2}.x(t)={v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2}+{C}_{2}.$\n\nIf\n\nx\n\n(0) =\n\nx\n\n0\n\n, we have\n\n${x}_{0}=0+0+{C}_{2};{x}_{0}=0+0+{C}_{2};$\n\nso,\n\nC\n\n2\n\n=\n\nx\n\n0\n\n. Substituting back into the equation for\n\nx\n\n(\n\nt\n\n), we finally have\n\n$x(t)={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2},x(t)={x}_{0}+{v}_{0}t+\\frac{1}{2}a{t}^{2},$\n\nwhich is\n\nEquation 3.13\n\n.\n\nExample\n\n3.17\n\nMotion of a Motorboat\n\nA motorboat is traveling at a constant velocity of 5.0 m/s when it starts to accelerate opposite to the motion to arrive at the dock. Its acceleration is\n\n$a(t)=â\\frac{1}{4}t\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{3}a(t)=â\\frac{1}{4}t\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{3}$\n\n. (a) What is the velocity function of the motorboat? (b) At what time does the velocity reach zero? (c) What is the position function of the motorboat? (d) What is the displacement of the motorboat from the time it begins to accelerate opposite to the motion to when the velocity is zero? (e) Graph the velocity and position functions.\n\nStrategy\n\n(a) To get the velocity function we must integrate and use initial conditions to find the constant of integration. (b) We set the velocity function equal to zero and solve for\n\nt\n\n. (c) Similarly, we must integrate to find the position function and use initial conditions to find the constant of integration. (d) Since the initial position is taken to be zero, we only have to evaluate the position function at the time when the velocity is zero.\n\nSolution\n\nWe take\n\nt\n\n= 0 to be the time when the boat starts to accelerate opposite to the motion.\n\nFrom the functional form of the acceleration we can solve\n\nEquation 3.18\n\nto get\n\nv\n\n(\n\nt\n\n):\n\n$v(t)=â«a(t)dt+{C}_{1}=â«â\\frac{1}{4}t\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{3}dt+{C}_{1}=â\\frac{1}{8}\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{3}{t}^{2}+{C}_{1}.v(t)=â«a(t)dt+{C}_{1}=â«â\\frac{1}{4}t\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{3}dt+{C}_{1}=â\\frac{1}{8}\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{3}{t}^{2}+{C}_{1}.$\n\nAt\n\nt\n\n= 0 we have\n\nv\n\n(0) = 5.0 m/s = 0 +\n\nC\n\n1\n\n, so\n\nC\n\n1\n\n= 5.0 m/s or\n\n$v(t)=5.0\\text{m/}\\text{s}â\\frac{1}{8}\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{3}{t}^{2}v(t)=5.0\\text{m/}\\text{s}â\\frac{1}{8}\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{3}{t}^{2}$\n\n.\n\n$v(t)=0=5.0\\text{m/}\\text{s}â\\frac{1}{8}{t}^{2}\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{3}ât=6.3\\text{s}v(t)=0=5.0\\text{m/}\\text{s}â\\frac{1}{8}{t}^{2}\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{3}ât=6.3\\text{s}$\n\nSolve\n\nEquation 3.19\n\n:\n\n$x(t)=â«v(t)dt+{C}_{2}=â«(5.0â\\frac{1}{8}{t}^{2})dt+{C}_{2}=5.0tm/sâ\\frac{1}{24}{t}^{3}\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{3}+{C}_{2}.x(t)=â«v(t)dt+{C}_{2}=â«(5.0â\\frac{1}{8}{t}^{2})dt+{C}_{2}=5.0tm/sâ\\frac{1}{24}{t}^{3}\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{3}+{C}_{2}.$\n\nAt\n\nt\n\n= 0, we set\n\nx\n\n(0) = 0 =\n\nx\n\n0\n\n, since we are only interested in the displacement from when the boat starts to accelerate opposite to the motion. We have\n\n$x(0)=0={C}_{2}.x(0)=0={C}_{2}.$\n\nTherefore, the equation for the position is\n\n$x(t)=5.0t\\text{m/s}â\\frac{1}{24}{t}^{3}\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{3}.x(t)=5.0t\\text{m/s}â\\frac{1}{24}{t}^{3}\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{3}.$\n\nSince the initial position is taken to be zero, we only have to evaluate the position function at the time when the velocity is zero. This occurs at\n\nt\n\n= 6.3 s.

The motorboat decreases its velocity to zero in 6.3 s. At times greater than this, velocity becomes negativeâmeaning, the boat is reversing direction. (b) Position of the motorboat as a function of time. At\n\nt\n\n= 6.3 s, the velocity is zero and the boat has stopped. At times greater than this, the velocity becomes negativeâmeaning, if the boat continues to move with the same acceleration, it reverses direction and heads back toward where it originated.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe acceleration function is linear in time so the integration involves simple polynomials. In\n\nFigure 3.30\n\n, we see that if we extend the solution beyond the point when the velocity is zero, the velocity becomes negative and the boat reverses direction. This tells us that solutions can give us information outside our immediate interest and we should be careful when interpreting them.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n3.8\n\nA particle starts from rest and has an acceleration function\n\n$a(t)=(5â(10\\frac{1}{s})t)\\frac{m}{{s}^{2}}a(t)=(5â(10\\frac{1}{s})t)\\frac{m}{{s}^{2}}$\n\n. (a) What is the velocity function? (b) What is the position function? (c) When is the velocity zero?"

From the stars, planets, and galaxies; to the motion of people and animals; down to the microscopic scale of atoms and moleculesâeverything in our universe is in motion. We can describe motion using the two disciplines of kinematics and dynamics. We study dynamics, which is concerned with the causes of motion, in\n\nNewtonâs Laws of Motion\n\n; but, there is much to be learned about motion without referring to what causes it, and this is the study of kinematics. Kinematics involves describing motion through properties such as position, time, velocity, and acceleration.\n\nA full treatment of\n\nkinematics\n\nconsiders motion in two and three dimensions. For now, we discuss motion in one dimension, which provides us with the tools necessary to study multidimensional motion. A good example of an object undergoing one-dimensional motion is the maglev (magnetic levitation) train depicted at the beginning of this chapter. As it travels, say, from Tokyo to Kyoto, it is at different positions along the track at various times in its journey, and therefore has displacements, or changes in position. It also has a variety of velocities along its path and it undergoes accelerations (changes in velocity). With the skills learned in this chapter we can calculate these quantities and average velocity. All these quantities can be described using kinematics, without knowing the trainâs mass or the forces involved."

In this chapter, it is limited to motion along a straight line, called one-dimensional motion.\n\nDisplacement is the change in position of an object. The SI unit for displacement is the meter. Displacement has direction as well as magnitude.\n\nDistance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between two positions.\n\nTime is measured in terms of change.

We can calculate the instantaneous velocity at a specific time by taking the derivative of the position function, which gives us the functional form of instantaneous velocity\n\nv\n\n(\n\nt\n\n).\n\nInstantaneous velocity is a vector and can be negative.\n\nInstantaneous speed is found by taking the absolute value of instantaneous velocity, and it is always positive.\n\nAverage speed is total distance traveled divided by elapsed time.\n\nThe slope of a position-versus-time graph at a specific time gives instantaneous velocity at that time.\n\n3.3\n\nAverage and Instantaneous Acceleration\n\nAcceleration is the rate at which velocity changes. The SI unit for acceleration is meters per second squared.\n\nAcceleration is a vector. It has both magnitude and direction and so can be the rate of change of the magnitude or direction of the velocity, or both.\n\nInstantaneous acceleration\n\na\n\n(\n\nt\n\n) is a continuous function of time and gives the acceleration at any specific time during the motion. It is calculated from the derivative of the velocity function. Instantaneous acceleration is the slope of the velocity-versus-time graph.\n\nNegative acceleration (sometimes called deceleration) is acceleration in the negative direction in the chosen coordinate system.\n\n3.4\n\nMotion with Constant Acceleration\n\nWhen analyzing one-dimensional motion with constant acceleration, identify the known quantities and choose the appropriate equations to solve for the unknowns. Either one or two of the kinematic equations are needed to solve for the unknowns, depending on the known and unknown quantities.\n\nTwo-body pursuit problems always require two equations to be solved simultaneously for the unknowns.\n\n3.5\n\nFree Fall\n\nAn object in free fall experiences constant acceleration if air resistance is negligible.\n\nOn Earth, all free-falling objects have an acceleration\n\ng\n\ndue to gravity, which averages\n\n$g=9.81{\\text{m/s}}^{2}g=9.81{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n.\n\nFor objects in free fall, the upward direction is normally taken as positive for displacement, velocity, and acceleration.\n\n3.6\n\nFinding Velocity and Displacement from Acceleration\n\nIntegral calculus gives us a more complete formulation of kinematics.\n\nIf acceleration\n\na\n\n(\n\nt\n\n) is known, we can use integral calculus to derive expressions for velocity\n\nv\n\n(\n\nt\n\n) and position\n\nx\n\n(\n\nt\n\n).\n\nIf acceleration is constant, the integral equations reduce to\n\nEquation 3.12\n\nand\n\nEquation 3.13\n\nfor motion with constant acceleration."

This will aid in our understanding of the displacement. We then use unit vectors to solve for the displacement.\n\nSolution\n\nFigure 4.4\n\nshows the surface of Earth and a circle that represents the orbit of the satellite. Although satellites are moving in three-dimensional space, they follow trajectories of ellipses, which can be graphed in two dimensions. The position vectors are drawn from the center of Earth, which we take to be the origin of the coordinate system, with the\n\ny\n\n-axis as north and the\n\nx\n\n-axis as east. The vector between them is the displacement of the satellite. We take the radius of Earth as 6370 km, so the length of each position vector is 6770 km.\n\nFigure\n\n4.4\n\nTwo position vectors are drawn from the center of Earth, which is the origin of the coordinate system, with the\n\ny\n\n-axis as north and the\n\nx\n\n-axis as east. The vector between them is the displacement of the satellite.\n\nIn unit vector notation, the position vectors are\n\n$râ({t}_{1})=6770.\\text{km}j^râ({t}_{2})=6770.\\text{km}(\\text{cos}(â45\\text{Â°}))i^+6770.\\text{km}(\\text{sin}(â45\\text{Â°}))j^.râ({t}_{1})=6770.\\text{km}j^râ({t}_{2})=6770.\\text{km}(\\text{cos}(â45\\text{Â°}))i^+6770.\\text{km}(\\text{sin}(â45\\text{Â°}))j^.$\n\nEvaluating the sine and cosine, we have\n\n$râ({t}_{1})=6770.j^râ({t}_{2})=4787i^â4787j^.râ({t}_{1})=6770.j^râ({t}_{2})=4787i^â4787j^.$\n\nNow we can find\n\n$\\text{Î}râ\\text{Î}râ$\n\n, the displacement of the satellite:\n\n$\\text{Î}râ=râ({t}_{2})ârâ({t}_{1})=4787i^â11,557j^.\\text{Î}râ=râ({t}_{2})ârâ({t}_{1})=4787i^â11,557j^.$\n\nThe magnitude of the displacement is\n\n$|\\text{Î}râ|=\\sqrt{{(4787)}^{2}+{(â11,557)}^{2}}=12,509\\text{km}.|\\text{Î}râ|=\\sqrt{{(4787)}^{2}+{(â11,557)}^{2}}=12,509\\text{km}.$\n\nThe angle the displacement makes with the\n\nx-\n\naxis is\n\n$Î¸={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{â11,557}{4787})=â67.5\\text{Â°}.Î¸={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{â11,557}{4787})=â67.5\\text{Â°}.$\n\nSignificance\n\nPlotting the displacement gives information and meaning to the unit vector solution to the problem. When plotting the displacement, we need to include its components as well as its magnitude and the angle it makes with a chosen axisâin this case, the\n\nx\n\n-axis (\n\nFigure 4.5\n\n).\n\nFigure\n\n4.5\n\nDisplacement vector with components, angle, and magnitude.\n\nNote that the satellite took a curved path along its circular orbit to get from its initial position to its final position in this example. It also could have traveled 4787 km east, then 11,557 km south to arrive at the same location. Both of these paths are longer than the length of the displacement vector. In fact, the displacement vector gives the shortest path between two points in one, two, or three dimensions.\n\nMany applications in physics can have a series of displacements, as discussed in the previous chapter. The total displacement is the sum of the individual displacements, only this time, we need to be careful, because we are adding vectors. We illustrate this concept with an example of Brownian motion.\n\nExample\n\n4.2\n\nBrownian Motion\n\nBrownian motion\n\nis a chaotic random motion of particles suspended in a fluid, resulting from collisions with the molecules of the fluid. This motion is three-dimensional. The displacements in numerical order of a particle undergoing Brownian motion could look like the following, in micrometers (\n\nFigure 4.6\n\n):\n\n$\\text{Î}{râ}_{1}=2.0i^+j^+3.0k^\\text{Î}{râ}_{2}=\\text{â}i^+3.0k^\\text{Î}{râ}_{3}=4.0i^â2.0j^+k^\\text{Î}{râ}_{4}=â3.0i^+j^+2.0k^.\\text{Î}{râ}_{1}=2.0i^+j^+3.0k^\\text{Î}{râ}_{2}=\\text{â}i^+3.0k^\\text{Î}{râ}_{3}=4.0i^â2.0j^+k^\\text{Î}{râ}_{4}=â3.0i^+j^+2.0k^.$\n\nWhat is the total displacement of the particle from the origin?\n\nFigure\n\n4.6\n\nTrajectory of a particle undergoing random displacements of Brownian motion. The total displacement is shown in red.\n\nSolution\n\nWe form the sum of the displacements and add them as vectors:\n\n$\\text{Î}{râ}_{\\text{Total}}=â\\text{Î}{râ}_{i}=\\text{Î}{râ}_{1}+\\text{Î}{râ}_{2}+\\text{Î}{râ}_{3}+\\text{Î}{râ}_{4}=(2.0â1.0+4.0â3.0)i^+(1.0+0â2.0+1.0)j^+(3.0+3.0+1.0+2.0)k^=2.0i^+0j^+9.0k^Î¼\\text{m}.\\text{Î}{râ}_{\\text{Total}}=â\\text{Î}{râ}_{i}=\\text{Î}{râ}_{1}+\\text{Î}{râ}_{2}+\\text{Î}{râ}_{3}+\\text{Î}{râ}_{4}=(2.0â1.0+4.0â3.0)i^+(1.0+0â2.0+1.0)j^+(3.0+3.0+1.0+2.0)k^=2.0i^+0j^+9.0k^Î¼\\text{m}.$\n\nTo complete the solution, we express the displacement as a magnitude and direction,\n\n$|\\text{Î}{râ}_{\\text{Total}}|=\\sqrt{{2.0}^{2}+{0}^{2}+{9.0}^{2}}=9.2Î¼\\text{m,}Î¸={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{9}{2})=77\\text{Â°},|\\text{Î}{râ}_{\\text{Total}}|=\\sqrt{{2.0}^{2}+{0}^{2}+{9.0}^{2}}=9.2Î¼\\text{m,}Î¸={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{9}{2})=77\\text{Â°},$\n\nwith respect to the\n\nx\n\n-axis in the\n\nxz-\n\nplane.\n\nSignificance\n\nFrom the figure we can see the magnitude of the total displacement is less than the sum of the magnitudes of the individual displacements.\n\nVelocity Vector\n\nIn the previous chapter we found the instantaneous velocity by calculating the derivative of the position function with respect to time. We can do the same operation in two and three dimensions, but we use vectors.

In\n\nFigure 4.7\n\nwe show the vectors\n\n$râ(t)râ(t)$\n\nand\n\n$râ(t+\\text{Î}t),râ(t+\\text{Î}t),$\n\nwhich give the position of a particle moving along a path represented by the gray line.

(b) Is the average velocity between 2 s and 4 s equal to the instantaneous velocity at\n\nt\n\n= 3 s?\n\nThe Independence of Perpendicular Motions\n\nWhen we look at the three-dimensional equations for position and velocity written in unit vector notation,\n\nEquation 4.2\n\nand\n\nEquation 4.5\n\n, we see the components of these equations are separate and unique functions of time that do not depend on one another. Motion along the\n\nx\n\ndirection has no part of its motion along the\n\ny\n\nand\n\nz\n\ndirections, and similarly for the other two coordinate axes. Thus, the motion of an object in two or three dimensions can be divided into separate, independent motions along the perpendicular axes of the coordinate system in which the motion takes place.\n\nTo illustrate this concept with respect to displacement, consider a woman walking from point\n\nA\n\nto point\n\nB\n\nin a city with square blocks. The woman taking the path from\n\nA\n\nto\n\nB\n\nmay walk east for so many blocks and then north (two perpendicular directions) for another set of blocks to arrive at\n\nB\n\n. How far she walks east is affected only by her motion eastward. Similarly, how far she walks north is affected only by her motion northward.\n\nIndependence of Motion\n\nIn the kinematic description of motion, we are able to treat the horizontal and vertical components of motion separately. In many cases, motion in the horizontal direction does not affect motion in the vertical direction, and vice versa.\n\nAn example illustrating the independence of vertical and horizontal motions is given by two baseballs. One baseball is dropped from rest. At the same instant, another is thrown horizontally from the same height and it follows a curved path. A stroboscope captures the positions of the balls at fixed time intervals as they fall (\n\nFigure 4.8\n\n).\n\nFigure\n\n4.8\n\nA diagram of the motions of two identical balls: one falls from rest and the other has an initial horizontal velocity. Each subsequent position is an equal time interval. Arrows represent the horizontal and vertical velocities at each position. The ball on the right has an initial horizontal velocity whereas the ball on the left has no horizontal velocity. Despite the difference in horizontal velocities, the vertical velocities and positions are identical for both balls, which shows the vertical and horizontal motions are independent.\n\nIt is remarkable that for each flash of the strobe, the vertical positions of the two balls are the same. This similarity implies vertical motion is independent of whether the ball is moving horizontally. (Assuming no air resistance, the vertical motion of a falling object is influenced by gravity only, not by any horizontal forces.) Careful examination of the ball thrown horizontally shows it travels the same horizontal distance between flashes. This is because there are no additional forces on the ball in the horizontal direction after it is thrown. This result means horizontal velocity is constant and is affected neither by vertical motion nor by gravity (which is vertical). Note this case is true for ideal conditions only. In the real world, air resistance affects the speed of the balls in both directions.\n\nThe two-dimensional curved path of the horizontally thrown ball is composed of two independent one-dimensional motions (horizontal and vertical). The key to analyzing such motion, called\n\nprojectile motion\n\n, is to resolve it into motions along perpendicular directions. Resolving two-dimensional motion into perpendicular components is possible because the components are independent."

This acceleration vector is the instantaneous acceleration and it can be obtained from the derivative with respect to time of the velocity function, as we have seen in a previous chapter. The only difference in two or three dimensions is that these are now vector quantities.

(b) What is the acceleration? (c) Describe the motion from\n\nt\n\n= 0 s.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe can gain some insight into the problem by looking at the position function. It is linear in\n\ny\n\nand\n\nz\n\n, so we know the acceleration in these directions is zero when we take the second derivative. Also, note that the position in the\n\nx\n\ndirection is zero for\n\nt\n\n= 0 s and\n\nt\n\n= 10 s.\n\nSolution\n\n(a) Taking the derivative with respect to time of the position function, we find\n\n$vâ(t)=(10â2t)i^+5j^+5k^\\text{m/s}.vâ(t)=(10â2t)i^+5j^+5k^\\text{m/s}.$\n\nThe velocity function is linear in time in the\n\nx\n\ndirection and is constant in the\n\ny\n\nand\n\nz\n\ndirections.\n\n(b) Taking the derivative of the velocity function, we find\n\n$aâ(t)=â2i^{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.aâ(t)=â2i^{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.$\n\nThe acceleration vector is a constant in the negative\n\nx\n\n-direction.\n\n(c) The trajectory of the particle can be seen in\n\nFigure 4.9\n\n. Letâs look in the\n\ny\n\nand\n\nz\n\ndirections first. The particleâs position increases steadily as a function of time with a constant velocity in these directions. In the\n\nx\n\ndirection, however, the particle follows a path in positive\n\nx\n\nuntil\n\nt\n\n= 5 s, when it reverses direction. We know this from looking at the velocity function, which becomes zero at this time and negative thereafter. We also know this because the acceleration is negative and constantâmeaning, the particle is accelerating in the opposite direction. The particleâs position reaches 25 m, where it then reverses direction and begins to accelerate in the negative\n\nx\n\ndirection. The position reaches zero at\n\nt\n\n= 10 s.\n\nFigure\n\n4.9\n\nThe particle starts at point (\n\nx\n\n,\n\ny\n\n,\n\nz\n\n) = (0, 0, 0) with position vector\n\n$râ=0râ=0$\n\nas shown with red stars. The projection of the trajectory onto the\n\nxy-\n\nplane is shown with blue dots. The values of\n\ny\n\nand\n\nz\n\nincrease linearly as a function of time, whereas\n\nx\n\nhas a turning point at\n\nt\n\n= 5 s and 25 m, when it reverses direction. At this point, the\n\nx\n\ncomponent of the velocity becomes negative. At\n\nt\n\n= 10 s, the particle is back to 0 m in the\n\nx\n\ndirection.\n\nSignificance\n\nBy graphing the trajectory of the particle, we can better understand its motion, given by the numerical results of the kinematic equations.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n4.2\n\nSuppose the acceleration function has the form\n\n$aâ(t)=ai^+bj^+ck^\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{2},aâ(t)=ai^+bj^+ck^\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{2},$\n\nwhere\n\na, b,\n\nand\n\nc\n\nare constants. What can be said about the functional form of the velocity function?\n\nConstant Acceleration\n\nMultidimensional motion with constant acceleration can be treated the same way as shown in the previous chapter for one-dimensional motion. Earlier we showed that three-dimensional motion is equivalent to three one-dimensional motions, each along an axis perpendicular to the others. To develop the relevant equations in each direction, letâs consider the two-dimensional problem of a particle moving in the\n\nxy\n\nplane with constant acceleration, ignoring the\n\nz\n\n-component for the moment. The acceleration vector is\n\n$aâ={a}_{0x}i^+{a}_{0y}j^.aâ={a}_{0x}i^+{a}_{0y}j^.$\n\nEach component of the motion has a separate set of equations similar to\n\nEquation 3.10\n\nâ\n\nEquation 3.14\n\nof the previous chapter on one-dimensional motion. We show only the equations for position and velocity in the\n\nx\n\n- and\n\ny\n\n-directions. A similar set of kinematic equations could be written for motion in the\n\nz\n\n-direction:\n\n$x(t)={x}_{0}+{({v}_{x})}_{\\text{avg}}tx(t)={x}_{0}+{({v}_{x})}_{\\text{avg}}t$\n\n4.11\n\n${v}_{x}(t)={v}_{0x}+{a}_{x}t{v}_{x}(t)={v}_{0x}+{a}_{x}t$\n\n4.12\n\n$x(t)={x}_{0}+{v}_{0x}t+\\frac{1}{2}{a}_{x}{t}^{2}x(t)={x}_{0}+{v}_{0x}t+\\frac{1}{2}{a}_{x}{t}^{2}$\n\n4.13\n\n${v}_{x}^{2}(t)={v}_{0x}^{2}+2{a}_{x}(xâ{x}_{0}){v}_{x}^{2}(t)={v}_{0x}^{2}+2{a}_{x}(xâ{x}_{0})$\n\n4.14\n\n$y(t)={y}_{0}+{({v}_{y})}_{\\text{avg}}ty(t)={y}_{0}+{({v}_{y})}_{\\text{avg}}t$\n\n4.15\n\n${v}_{y}(t)={v}_{0y}+{a}_{y}t{v}_{y}(t)={v}_{0y}+{a}_{y}t$\n\n4.16\n\n$y(t)={y}_{0}+{v}_{0y}t+\\frac{1}{2}{a}_{y}{t}^{2}y(t)={y}_{0}+{v}_{0y}t+\\frac{1}{2}{a}_{y}{t}^{2}$\n\n4.17\n\n${v}_{y}^{2}(t)={v}_{0y}^{2}+2{a}_{y}(yâ{y}_{0}).{v}_{y}^{2}(t)={v}_{0y}^{2}+2{a}_{y}(yâ{y}_{0}).$\n\n4.18\n\nHere the subscript 0 denotes the initial position or velocity.\n\nEquation 4.11\n\nto\n\nEquation 4.18\n\ncan be substituted into\n\nEquation 4.2\n\nand\n\nEquation 4.5\n\nwithout the\n\nz\n\n-component to obtain the position vector and velocity vector as a function of time in two dimensions:\n\n$râ(t)=x(t)i^+y(t)j^\\text{and}vâ(t)={v}_{x}(t)i^+{v}_{y}(t)j^.râ(t)=x(t)i^+y(t)j^\\text{and}vâ(t)={v}_{x}(t)i^+{v}_{y}(t)j^.$\n\nThe following example illustrates a practical use of the kinematic equations in two dimensions.\n\nExample\n\n4.6\n\nA Skier\n\nFigure 4.10\n\nshows a skier moving with an acceleration of\n\n$2.1\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{2}2.1\\text{m/}{\\text{s}}^{2}$\n\ndown a slope of\n\n$15\\text{Â°}15\\text{Â°}$\n\nat\n\nt\n\n= 0.

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nUse one-dimensional motion in perpendicular directions to analyze projectile motion.\n\nCalculate the range, time of flight, and maximum height of a projectile that is launched and impacts a flat, horizontal surface.\n\nFind the time of flight and impact velocity of a projectile that lands at a different height from that of launch.\n\nCalculate the trajectory of a projectile.\n\nProjectile motion\n\nis the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject only to acceleration as a result of gravity. The applications of projectile motion in physics and engineering are numerous. Some examples include meteors as they enter Earthâs atmosphere, fireworks, and the motion of any ball in sports. Such objects are called\n\nprojectiles\n\nand their path is called a\n\ntrajectory\n\n. The motion of falling objects as discussed in\n\nMotion Along a Straight Line\n\nis a simple one-dimensional type of projectile motion in which there is no horizontal movement. In this section, we consider two-dimensional projectile motion, and our treatment neglects the effects of air resistance.\n\nThe most important fact to remember here is that\n\nmotions along perpendicular axes are independent\n\nand thus can be analyzed separately. We discussed this fact in\n\nDisplacement and Velocity Vectors\n\n, where we saw that vertical and horizontal motions are independent. The key to analyzing two-dimensional projectile motion is to break it into two motions: one along the horizontal axis and the other along the vertical. (This choice of axes is the most sensible because acceleration resulting from gravity is vertical; thus, there is no acceleration along the horizontal axis when air resistance is negligible.) As is customary, we call the horizontal axis the\n\nx\n\n-axis and the vertical axis the\n\ny\n\n-axis. It is not required that we use this choice of axes; it is simply convenient in the case of gravitational acceleration. In other cases we may choose a different set of axes.\n\nFigure 4.11\n\nillustrates the notation for displacement, where we define\n\n$sâsâ$\n\nto be the total displacement, and\n\n$xâxâ$\n\nand\n\n$yâyâ$\n\nare its component vectors along the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. The magnitudes of these vectors are\n\ns\n\n,\n\nx\n\n, and\n\ny\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n4.11\n\nThe total displacement\n\ns\n\nof a soccer ball at a point along its path.

Its magnitude is\n\ns\n\nand it makes an angle\n\nÎ¦\n\nwith the horizontal.\n\nTo describe\n\nprojectile motion\n\ncompletely, we must include velocity and acceleration, as well as displacement. We must find their components along the\n\nx-\n\nand\n\ny\n\n-axes. Letâs assume all forces except gravity (such as air resistance and friction, for example) are negligible. Defining the positive direction to be upward, the components of acceleration are then very simple:\n\n${a}_{y}=\\text{â}g=â9.8\\text{m}\\text{/}{\\text{s}}^{2}(â32\\text{ft}\\text{/}{\\text{s}}^{2}).{a}_{y}=\\text{â}g=â9.8\\text{m}\\text{/}{\\text{s}}^{2}(â32\\text{ft}\\text{/}{\\text{s}}^{2}).$\n\nBecause gravity is vertical,\n\n${a}_{x}=0.{a}_{x}=0.$\n\nIf\n\n${a}_{x}=0,{a}_{x}=0,$\n\nthis means the initial velocity in the\n\nx\n\ndirection is equal to the final velocity in the\n\nx\n\ndirection, or\n\n${v}_{x}={v}_{0x}.{v}_{x}={v}_{0x}.$\n\nWith these conditions on acceleration and velocity, we can write the kinematic\n\nEquation 4.11\n\nthrough\n\nEquation 4.18\n\nfor motion in a uniform gravitational field, including the rest of the kinematic equations for a constant acceleration from\n\nMotion with Constant Acceleration\n\n.

(b) The horizontal motion is simple, because\n\n${a}_{x}=0{a}_{x}=0$\n\nand\n\n${v}_{x}{v}_{x}$\n\nis a constant. (c) The velocity in the vertical direction begins to decrease as the object rises. At its highest point, the vertical velocity is zero. As the object falls toward Earth again, the vertical velocity increases again in magnitude but points in the opposite direction to the initial vertical velocity. (d) The\n\nx\n\nand\n\ny\n\nmotions are recombined to give the total velocity at any given point on the trajectory.\n\nExample\n\n4.7\n\nA Fireworks Projectile Explodes High and Away\n\nDuring a fireworks display, a shell is shot into the air with an initial speed of 70.0 m/s at an angle of\n\n$75.0\\text{Â°}75.0\\text{Â°}$\n\nabove the horizontal, as illustrated in\n\nFigure 4.13\n\n. The fuse is timed to ignite the shell just as it reaches its highest point above the ground. (a) Calculate the height at which the shell explodes. (b) How much time passes between the launch of the shell and the explosion? (c) What is the horizontal displacement of the shell when it explodes? (d) What is the total displacement from the point of launch to the highest point?\n\nFigure\n\n4.13\n\nThe trajectory of a fireworks shell. The fuse is set to explode the shell at the highest point in its trajectory, which is found to be at a height of 233 m and 125 m away horizontally.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe motion can be broken into horizontal and vertical motions in which\n\n${a}_{x}=0{a}_{x}=0$\n\nand\n\n${a}_{y}=\\text{â}g.{a}_{y}=\\text{â}g.$\n\nWe can then define\n\n${x}_{0}{x}_{0}$\n\nand\n\n${y}_{0}{y}_{0}$\n\nto be zero and solve for the desired quantities.\n\nSolution\n\n(a) By âheightâ we mean the altitude or vertical position\n\ny\n\nabove the starting point. The highest point in any trajectory, called the\n\napex\n\n, is reached when\n\n${v}_{y}=0.{v}_{y}=0.$\n\nSince we know the initial and final velocities, as well as the initial position, we use the following equation to find\n\ny\n\n:\n\n${v}_{y}^{2}={v}_{0y}^{2}â2g(yâ{y}_{0}).{v}_{y}^{2}={v}_{0y}^{2}â2g(yâ{y}_{0}).$\n\nBecause\n\n${y}_{0}{y}_{0}$\n\nand\n\n${v}_{y}{v}_{y}$\n\nare both zero, the equation simplifies to\n\n$\\text{0}={v}_{0y}^{2}â2gy.\\text{0}={v}_{0y}^{2}â2gy.$\n\nSolving for\n\ny\n\ngives\n\n$y=\\frac{{v}_{0y}^{2}}{2g}.y=\\frac{{v}_{0y}^{2}}{2g}.$\n\nNow we must find\n\n${v}_{0y},{v}_{0y},$\n\nthe component of the initial velocity in the\n\ny\n\ndirection. It is given by\n\n${v}_{0y}={v}_{0}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{0},{v}_{0y}={v}_{0}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{0},$\n\nwhere\n\n${v}_{0}{v}_{0}$\n\nis the initial velocity of 70.0 m/s and\n\n${Î¸}_{0}=75\\text{Â°}{Î¸}_{0}=75\\text{Â°}$\n\nis the initial angle. Thus,\n\n${v}_{0y}={v}_{0}\\text{sin}Î¸=(70.0\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s})\\text{sin}75\\text{Â°}=67.6\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}{v}_{0y}={v}_{0}\\text{sin}Î¸=(70.0\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s})\\text{sin}75\\text{Â°}=67.6\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}$\n\nand\n\ny\n\nis\n\n$y=\\frac{{(67.6\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s})}^{2}}{2(9.80\\text{m}\\text{/}{\\text{s}}^{2})}.y=\\frac{{(67.6\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s})}^{2}}{2(9.80\\text{m}\\text{/}{\\text{s}}^{2})}.$\n\nThus, we have\n\n$y=233\\text{m}\\text{.}y=233\\text{m}\\text{.}$\n\nNote that because up is positive, the initial vertical velocity is positive, as is the maximum height, but the acceleration resulting from gravity is negative. Note also that the maximum height depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity, so that any projectile with a 67.6-m/s initial vertical component of velocity reaches a maximum height of 233 m (neglecting air resistance). The numbers in this example are reasonable for large fireworks displays, the shells of which do reach such heights before exploding. In practice, air resistance is not completely negligible, so the initial velocity would have to be somewhat larger than that given to reach the same height.\n\n(b) As in many physics problems, there is more than one way to solve for the time the projectile reaches its highest point. In this case, the easiest method is to use\n\n${v}_{y}={v}_{0y}âgt.{v}_{y}={v}_{0y}âgt.$\n\nBecause\n\n${v}_{y}=0{v}_{y}=0$\n\nat the apex, this equation reduces to simply\n\n$0={v}_{0y}âgt0={v}_{0y}âgt$\n\nor\n\n$t=\\frac{{v}_{0y}}{g}=\\frac{67.6\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}}{9.80\\text{m}\\text{/}{\\text{s}}^{2}}=6.90\\text{s}\\text{.}t=\\frac{{v}_{0y}}{g}=\\frac{67.6\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}}{9.80\\text{m}\\text{/}{\\text{s}}^{2}}=6.90\\text{s}\\text{.}$\n\nThis time is also reasonable for large fireworks. If you are able to see the launch of fireworks, notice that several seconds pass before the shell explodes. Another way of finding the time is by using\n\n$y\\text{=}{y}_{0}+\\frac{1}{2}({v}_{0y}+{v}_{y})t.y\\text{=}{y}_{0}+\\frac{1}{2}({v}_{0y}+{v}_{y})t.$\n\nThis is left for you as an exercise to complete.\n\n(c) Because air resistance is negligible,\n\n${a}_{x}=0{a}_{x}=0$\n\nand the horizontal velocity is constant, as discussed earlier. The horizontal displacement is the horizontal velocity multiplied by time as given by\n\n$x={x}_{0}+{v}_{x}t,x={x}_{0}+{v}_{x}t,$\n\nwhere\n\n${x}_{0}{x}_{0}$\n\nis equal to zero. Thus,\n\n$x={v}_{x}t,x={v}_{x}t,$\n\nwhere\n\n${v}_{x}{v}_{x}$\n\nis the\n\nx\n\n-component of the velocity, which is given by\n\n${v}_{x}={v}_{0}\\text{cos}Î¸=(70.0\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s})\\text{cos}75\\text{Â°}=18.1\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}.{v}_{x}={v}_{0}\\text{cos}Î¸=(70.0\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s})\\text{cos}75\\text{Â°}=18.1\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}.$\n\nTime\n\nt\n\nfor both motions is the same, so\n\nx\n\nis\n\n$x=(18.1\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s})6.90\\text{s}=125\\text{m}\\text{.}x=(18.1\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s})6.90\\text{s}=125\\text{m}\\text{.}$\n\nHorizontal motion is a constant velocity in the absence of air resistance. The horizontal displacement found here could be useful in keeping the fireworks fragments from falling on spectators. When the shell explodes, air resistance has a major effect, and many fragments land directly below.\n\n(d) The horizontal and vertical components of the displacement were just calculated, so all that is needed here is to find the magnitude and direction of the displacement at the highest point:\n\n$sâ=125i^+233j^sâ=125i^+233j^$\n\n$|sâ|=\\sqrt{{125}^{2}+{233}^{2}}=264\\text{m}|sâ|=\\sqrt{{125}^{2}+{233}^{2}}=264\\text{m}$\n\n$Î¦={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{233}{125})=61.8\\text{Â°}.Î¦={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{233}{125})=61.8\\text{Â°}.$\n\nNote that the angle for the displacement vector is less than the initial angle of launch. To see why this is, review\n\nFigure 4.11\n\n, which shows the curvature of the trajectory toward the ground level.\n\nWhen solving\n\nExample 4.7\n\n(a), the expression we found for\n\ny\n\nis valid for any projectile motion when air resistance is negligible. Call the maximum height\n\ny\n\n=\n\nh\n\n. Then,\n\n$h=\\frac{{v}_{0y}^{2}}{2g}.h=\\frac{{v}_{0y}^{2}}{2g}.$\n\nThis equation defines the\n\nmaximum height of a projectile above its launch position\n\nand it depends only on the vertical component of the initial velocity.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n4.3\n\nA rock is thrown horizontally off a cliff\n\n$100.0\\text{m}100.0\\text{m}$\n\nhigh with a velocity of 15.0 m/s.

On its way down, the ball is caught by a spectator 10 m above the point where the ball was hit. (a) Calculate the time it takes the tennis ball to reach the spectator. (b) What are the magnitude and direction of the ballâs velocity at impact?\n\nFigure\n\n4.14\n\nThe trajectory of a tennis ball hit into the stands.\n\nStrategy\n\nAgain, resolving this two-dimensional motion into two independent one-dimensional motions allows us to solve for the desired quantities. The time a projectile is in the air is governed by its vertical motion alone. Thus, we solve for\n\nt\n\nfirst. While the ball is rising and falling vertically, the horizontal motion continues at a constant velocity. This example asks for the final velocity. Thus, we recombine the vertical and horizontal results to obtain\n\n$vâvâ$\n\nat final time\n\nt\n\n, determined in the first part of the example.\n\nSolution\n\n(a) While the ball is in the air, it rises and then falls to a final position 10.0 m higher than its starting altitude. We can find the time for this by using\n\nEquation 4.22\n\n:\n\n$y\\text{=}{y}_{0}\\text{+}{v}_{0y}tâ\\frac{1}{2}g{t}^{2}.y\\text{=}{y}_{0}\\text{+}{v}_{0y}tâ\\frac{1}{2}g{t}^{2}.$\n\nIf we take the initial position\n\n${y}_{0}{y}_{0}$\n\nto be zero, then the final position is\n\ny\n\n= 10 m. The initial vertical velocity is the vertical component of the initial velocity:\n\n${v}_{0y}={v}_{0}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{0}=(30.0\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s})\\text{sin}45\\text{Â°}=21.2\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}.{v}_{0y}={v}_{0}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{0}=(30.0\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s})\\text{sin}45\\text{Â°}=21.2\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}.$\n\nSubstituting into\n\nEquation 4.22\n\nfor\n\ny\n\ngives us\n\n$10.0\\text{m}=(21.2\\text{m/s})tâ(4.90{\\text{m/s}}^{\\text{2}}){t}^{2}.10.0\\text{m}=(21.2\\text{m/s})tâ(4.90{\\text{m/s}}^{\\text{2}}){t}^{2}.$\n\nRearranging terms gives a quadratic equation in\n\nt\n\n:\n\n$(4.90{\\text{m/s}}^{\\text{2}}){t}^{2}â(21.2\\text{m/s})t+10.0\\text{m}=0.(4.90{\\text{m/s}}^{\\text{2}}){t}^{2}â(21.2\\text{m/s})t+10.0\\text{m}=0.$\n\nUse of the quadratic formula yields\n\nt\n\n= 3.79 s and\n\nt\n\n= 0.54 s. Since the ball is at a height of 10 m at two times during its trajectoryâonce on the way up and once on the way downâwe take the longer solution for the time it takes the ball to reach the spectator:\n\n$t=3.79\\text{s}\\text{.}t=3.79\\text{s}\\text{.}$\n\nThe time for projectile motion is determined completely by the vertical motion. Thus, any projectile that has an initial vertical velocity of 21.2 m/s and lands 10.0 m above its starting altitude spends 3.79 s in the air.\n\n(b) We can find the final horizontal and vertical velocities\n\n${v}_{x}{v}_{x}$\n\nand\n\n${v}_{y}{v}_{y}$\n\nwith the use of the result from (a). Then, we can combine them to find the magnitude of the total velocity vector\n\n$vâvâ$\n\nand the angle\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\nit makes with the horizontal. Since\n\n${v}_{x}{v}_{x}$\n\nis constant, we can solve for it at any horizontal location. We choose the starting point because we know both the initial velocity and the initial angle.

Thus, any projectile that has an initial vertical velocity of 21.2 m/s and lands 10.0 m above its starting altitude spends 3.79 s in the air. (b) The negative angle means the velocity is\n\n$36.9\\text{Â°}36.9\\text{Â°}$\n\nbelow the horizontal at the point of impact. This result is consistent with the fact that the ball is impacting at a point on the other side of the apex of the trajectory and therefore has a negative\n\ny\n\ncomponent of the velocity. The magnitude of the velocity is less than the magnitude of the initial velocity we expect since it is impacting 10.0 m above the launch elevation.\n\nTime of Flight, Trajectory, and Range\n\nOf interest are the time of flight, trajectory, and range for a projectile launched on a flat horizontal surface and impacting on the same surface. In this case, kinematic equations give useful expressions for these quantities, which are derived in the following sections.\n\nTime of flight\n\nWe can solve for the time of flight of a projectile that is both launched and impacts on a flat horizontal surface by performing some manipulations of the kinematic equations. We note the position and displacement in\n\ny\n\nmust be zero at launch and at impact on an even surface. Thus, we set the displacement in\n\ny\n\nequal to zero and find\n\n$yâ{y}_{0}={v}_{0y}tâ\\frac{1}{2}g{t}^{2}=({v}_{0}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{0})tâ\\frac{1}{2}g{t}^{2}=0.yâ{y}_{0}={v}_{0y}tâ\\frac{1}{2}g{t}^{2}=({v}_{0}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{0})tâ\\frac{1}{2}g{t}^{2}=0.$\n\nFactoring, we have\n\n$t({v}_{0}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{0}â\\frac{gt}{2})=0.t({v}_{0}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{0}â\\frac{gt}{2})=0.$\n\nSolving for\n\nt\n\ngives us\n\n${T}_{\\text{tof}}=\\frac{2({v}_{0}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{0})}{g}.{T}_{\\text{tof}}=\\frac{2({v}_{0}\\text{sin}{Î¸}_{0})}{g}.$\n\n4.24\n\nThis is the\n\ntime of flight\n\nfor a projectile both launched and impacting on a flat horizontal surface.\n\nEquation 4.24\n\ndoes not apply when the projectile lands at a different elevation than it was launched, as we saw in\n\nExample 4.8\n\nof the tennis player hitting the ball into the stands. The other solution,\n\nt\n\n= 0, corresponds to the time at launch. The time of flight is linearly proportional to the initial velocity in the\n\ny\n\ndirection and inversely proportional to\n\ng\n\n. Thus, on the Moon, where gravity is one-sixth that of Earth, a projectile launched with the same velocity as on Earth would be airborne six times as long.\n\nTrajectory\n\nThe\n\ntrajectory\n\nof a projectile can be found by eliminating the time variable\n\nt\n\nfrom the kinematic equations for arbitrary\n\nt\n\nand solving for\n\ny\n\n(\n\nx\n\n).

Using the trigonometric identity\n\n$2\\text{sin}Î¸\\text{cos}Î¸=\\text{sin}2Î¸2\\text{sin}Î¸\\text{cos}Î¸=\\text{sin}2Î¸$\n\nand setting\n\nx\n\n=\n\nR\n\nfor range, we find\n\n$R=\\frac{{v}_{0}^{2}\\text{sin}2{Î¸}_{0}}{g}.R=\\frac{{v}_{0}^{2}\\text{sin}2{Î¸}_{0}}{g}.$\n\n4.26\n\nNote particularly that\n\nEquation 4.26\n\nis valid only for launch and impact on a horizontal surface. We see the range is directly proportional to the square of the initial speed\n\n${v}_{0}{v}_{0}$\n\nand\n\n$\\text{sin}2{Î¸}_{0}\\text{sin}2{Î¸}_{0}$\n\n, and it is inversely proportional to the acceleration of gravity. Thus, on the Moon, the range would be six times greater than on Earth for the same initial velocity. Furthermore, we see from the factor\n\n$\\text{sin}2{Î¸}_{0}\\text{sin}2{Î¸}_{0}$\n\nthat the range is maximum at\n\n$45\\text{Â°}.45\\text{Â°}.$\n\nThese results are shown in\n\nFigure 4.15\n\n. In (a) we see that the greater the initial velocity, the greater the range. In (b), we see that the range is maximum at\n\n$45\\text{Â°}.45\\text{Â°}.$\n\nThis is true only for conditions neglecting air resistance. If air resistance is considered, the maximum angle is somewhat smaller. It is interesting that the same range is found for two initial launch angles that sum to\n\n$90\\text{Â°}.90\\text{Â°}.$\n\nThe projectile launched with the smaller angle has a lower apex than the higher angle, but they both have the same range.\n\nFigure\n\n4.15\n\nTrajectories of projectiles on level ground.

They angle the shot low to the ground at\n\n$30\\text{Â°}30\\text{Â°}$\n\nto the horizontal to let the ball roll after impact. On the fourth hole they are 90 m from the green and want to let the ball drop with a minimum amount of rolling after impact.

If, however, the range is large, Earth curves away below the projectile and the acceleration resulting from gravity changes direction along the path. The range is larger than predicted by the range equation given earlier because the projectile has farther to fall than it would on level ground, as shown in\n\nFigure 4.17\n\n, which is based on a drawing in Newtonâs\n\nPrincipia.\n\nIf the initial speed is great enough, the projectile goes into orbit. Earthâs surface drops 5 m every 8000 m. In 1 s an object falls 5 m without air resistance. Thus, if an object is given a horizontal velocity of 8000 m/s (or 18,000 mi/hr) near Earthâs surface, it will go into orbit around the planet because the surface continuously falls away from the object. This is roughly the speed of the Space Shuttle in a low Earth orbit when it was operational, or any satellite in a low Earth orbit. These and other aspects of orbital motion, such as Earthâs rotation, are covered in greater depth in\n\nGravitation\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n4.17\n\nProjectile to satellite. In each case shown here, a projectile is launched from a very high tower to avoid air resistance. With increasing initial speed, the range increases and becomes longer than it would be on level ground because Earth curves away beneath its path. With a speed of 8000 m/s, orbit is achieved.\n\nInteractive\n\nAt\n\nPhET Explorations: Projectile Motion\n\n, learn about projectile motion in terms of the launch angle and initial velocity."

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nSolve for the centripetal acceleration of an object moving on a circular path.\n\nUse the equations of circular motion to find the position, velocity, and acceleration of a particle executing circular motion.\n\nExplain the differences between centripetal acceleration and tangential acceleration resulting from nonuniform circular motion.\n\nEvaluate centripetal and tangential acceleration in nonuniform circular motion, and find the total acceleration vector.\n\nUniform circular motion is a specific type of motion in which an object travels in a circle with a constant speed. For example, any point on a propeller spinning at a constant rate is executing uniform circular motion. Other examples are the second, minute, and hour hands of a watch. It is remarkable that points on these rotating objects are actually accelerating, although the rotation rate is a constant. To see this, we must analyze the motion in terms of vectors.\n\nCentripetal Acceleration\n\nIn one-dimensional kinematics, objects with a constant speed have zero acceleration. However, in two- and three-dimensional kinematics, even if the speed is a constant, a particle can have acceleration if it moves along a curved trajectory such as a circle. In this case the velocity vector is changing, or\n\n$dvâ\\text{/}dtâ0.dvâ\\text{/}dtâ0.$\n\nThis is shown in\n\nFigure 4.18\n\n. As the particle moves counterclockwise in time\n\n$\\text{Î}t\\text{Î}t$\n\non the circular path, its position vector moves from\n\n$râ(t)râ(t)$\n\nto\n\n$râ(t+\\text{Î}t).râ(t+\\text{Î}t).$\n\nThe velocity vector has constant magnitude and is tangent to the path as it changes from\n\n$vâ(t)vâ(t)$\n\nto\n\n$vâ(t+\\text{Î}t),vâ(t+\\text{Î}t),$\n\nchanging its direction only. Since the velocity vector\n\n$vâ(t)vâ(t)$\n\nis perpendicular to the position vector\n\n$râ(t),râ(t),$\n\nthe triangles formed by the position vectors and\n\n$\\text{Î}râ,\\text{Î}râ,$\n\nand the velocity vectors and\n\n$\\text{Î}vâ\\text{Î}vâ$\n\nare similar. Furthermore, since\n\n$|râ(t)|=|râ(t+\\text{Î}t)||râ(t)|=|râ(t+\\text{Î}t)|$\n\nand\n\n$|vâ(t)|=|vâ(t+\\text{Î}t)|,|vâ(t)|=|vâ(t+\\text{Î}t)|,$\n\nthe two triangles are isosceles. From these facts we can make the assertion\n\n$\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{v}=\\frac{\\text{Î}r}{r}\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{v}=\\frac{\\text{Î}r}{r}$\n\nor\n\n$\\text{Î}v=\\frac{v}{r}\\text{Î}r.\\text{Î}v=\\frac{v}{r}\\text{Î}r.$\n\nFigure\n\n4.18\n\n(a) A particle is moving in a circle at a constant speed, with position and velocity vectors at times\n\n$tt$\n\nand\n\n$t+\\text{Î}t.t+\\text{Î}t.$\n\n(b) Velocity vectors forming a triangle.

Summarizing, a particle moving in a circle at a constant speed has an acceleration with magnitude\n\n${a}_{\\text{c}}=\\frac{{v}^{2}}{r}.{a}_{\\text{c}}=\\frac{{v}^{2}}{r}.$\n\n4.27\n\nThe direction of the acceleration vector is toward the center of the circle (\n\nFigure 4.19\n\n). This is a radial acceleration and is called the\n\ncentripetal acceleration\n\n, which is why we give it the subscript c. The word\n\ncentripetal\n\ncomes from the Latin words\n\ncentrum\n\n(meaning âcenterâ) and\n\npetere\n\n(meaning âto seekâ), and thus takes the meaning âcenter seeking.â\n\nFigure\n\n4.19\n\nThe centripetal acceleration vector points toward the center of the circular path of motion and is an acceleration in the radial direction. The velocity vector is also shown and is tangent to the circle.\n\nLetâs investigate some examples that illustrate the relative magnitudes of the velocity, radius, and centripetal acceleration.\n\nExample\n\n4.10\n\nCreating an Acceleration of 1\n\ng\n\nA jet is flying at 134.1 m/s along a straight line and makes a turn along a circular path level with the ground.

This was completely arbitrary. If a different starting position were given, we would have a different final position at\n\nt\n\n= 200 ns.\n\nNonuniform Circular Motion\n\nCircular motion does not have to be at a constant speed. A particle can travel in a circle and speed up or slow down, showing an acceleration in the direction of the motion.\n\nIn uniform circular motion, the particle executing circular motion has a constant speed and the circle is at a fixed radius. If the speed of the particle is changing as well, then we introduce an additional acceleration in the direction tangential to the circle. Such accelerations occur at a point on a top that is changing its spin rate, or any accelerating rotor. In\n\nDisplacement and Velocity Vectors\n\nwe showed that centripetal acceleration is the time rate of change of the direction of the velocity vector. If the speed of the particle is changing, then it has a\n\ntangential acceleration\n\nthat is the time rate of change of the magnitude of the velocity:\n\n${a}_{\\text{T}}=\\frac{d|vâ|}{dt}.{a}_{\\text{T}}=\\frac{d|vâ|}{dt}.$\n\n4.31\n\nThe direction of tangential acceleration is tangent to the circle whereas the direction of centripetal acceleration is radially inward toward the center of the circle. Thus, a particle in circular motion with a tangential acceleration has a\n\ntotal acceleration\n\nthat is the vector sum of the centripetal and tangential accelerations:\n\n$aâ={aâ}_{\\text{c}}+{aâ}_{\\text{T}}.aâ={aâ}_{\\text{c}}+{aâ}_{\\text{T}}.$\n\n4.32\n\nThe acceleration vectors are shown in\n\nFigure 4.22\n\n. Note that the two acceleration vectors\n\n${aâ}_{\\text{c}}{aâ}_{\\text{c}}$\n\nand\n\n${aâ}_{\\text{T}}{aâ}_{\\text{T}}$\n\nare perpendicular to each other, with\n\n${aâ}_{\\text{c}}{aâ}_{\\text{c}}$\n\nin the radial direction and\n\n${aâ}_{\\text{T}}{aâ}_{\\text{T}}$\n\nin the tangential direction. The total acceleration\n\n$aâaâ$\n\npoints at an angle between\n\n${aâ}_{\\text{c}}{aâ}_{\\text{c}}$\n\nand\n\n${aâ}_{\\text{T}}.{aâ}_{\\text{T}}.$\n\nFigure\n\n4.22\n\nThe centripetal acceleration points toward the center of the circle. The tangential acceleration is tangential to the circle at the particleâs position. The total acceleration is the vector sum of the tangential and centripetal accelerations, which are perpendicular.\n\nExample\n\n4.12\n\nTotal Acceleration during Circular Motion\n\nA particle moves in a circle of radius\n\nr\n\n= 2.0 m. During the time interval from\n\nt\n\n= 1.5 s to\n\nt\n\n= 4.0 s its speed varies with time according to\n\n$v(t)={c}_{1}â\\frac{{c}_{2}}{{t}^{2}},{c}_{1}=4.0\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s,}{c}_{2}=6.0\\text{m}Â·\\text{s}\\text{.}v(t)={c}_{1}â\\frac{{c}_{2}}{{t}^{2}},{c}_{1}=4.0\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s,}{c}_{2}=6.0\\text{m}Â·\\text{s}\\text{.}$\n\nWhat is the total acceleration of the particle at\n\nt\n\n= 2.0 s?\n\nStrategy\n\nWe are given the speed of the particle and the radius of the circle, so we can calculate centripetal acceleration easily. The direction of the centripetal acceleration is toward the center of the circle. We find the magnitude of the tangential acceleration by taking the derivative with respect to time of\n\n$|v(t)||v(t)|$\n\nusing\n\nEquation 4.31\n\nand evaluating it at\n\nt\n\n= 2.0 s. We use this and the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration to find the total acceleration.\n\nSolution\n\nCentripetal acceleration is\n\n$v(2.0\\text{s})=(4.0â\\frac{6.0}{{(2.0)}^{2}})\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}=2.5\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}v(2.0\\text{s})=(4.0â\\frac{6.0}{{(2.0)}^{2}})\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}=2.5\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}$\n\n${a}_{\\text{c}}=\\frac{{v}^{2}}{r}=\\frac{(2.5\\text{m}\\text{/}{\\text{s})}^{2}}{2.0\\text{m}}=3.1\\text{m}\\text{/}{\\text{s}}^{2}{a}_{\\text{c}}=\\frac{{v}^{2}}{r}=\\frac{(2.5\\text{m}\\text{/}{\\text{s})}^{2}}{2.0\\text{m}}=3.1\\text{m}\\text{/}{\\text{s}}^{2}$\n\ndirected toward the center of the circle.

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nExplain the concept of reference frames.\n\nWrite the position and velocity vector equations for relative motion.\n\nDraw the position and velocity vectors for relative motion.\n\nAnalyze one-dimensional and two-dimensional relative motion problems using the position and velocity vector equations.\n\nMotion does not happen in isolation. If youâre riding in a train moving at 10 m/s east, this velocity is measured relative to the ground on which youâre traveling. However, if another train passes you at 15 m/s east, your velocity relative to this other train is different from your velocity relative to the ground. Your velocity relative to the other train is 5 m/s west. To explore this idea further, we first need to establish some terminology.\n\nReference Frames\n\nTo discuss relative motion in one or more dimensions, we first introduce the concept of\n\nreference frame\n\ns\n\n. When we say an object has a certain velocity, we must state it has a velocity with respect to a given reference frame. In most examples we have examined so far, this reference frame has been Earth. If you say a person is sitting in a train moving at 10 m/s east, then you imply the person on the train is moving relative to the surface of Earth at this velocity, and Earth is the reference frame. We can expand our view of the motion of the person on the train and say Earth is spinning in its orbit around the Sun, in which case the motion becomes more complicated. In this case, the solar system is the reference frame. In summary, all discussion of relative motion must define the reference frames involved. We now develop a method to refer to reference frames in relative motion. This method makes an approximation that breaks down near the speed of light, where the more accurate methods or special relativity are needed, but is extremely accurate for everyday speeds (\n\nRelativity\n\n).\n\nRelative Motion in One Dimension\n\nWe introduce relative motion in one dimension first, because the velocity vectors simplify to having only two possible directions. Take the example of the person sitting in a train moving east. If we choose east as the positive direction and Earth as the reference frame, then we can write the velocity of the train with respect to the Earth as\n\n${vâ}_{\\text{TE}}=10\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}i^{vâ}_{\\text{TE}}=10\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}i^$\n\neast, where the subscripts TE refer to train and Earth. Letâs now say the person gets up out of her seat and walks toward the back of the train at 2 m/s. This tells us she has a velocity relative to the reference frame of the train. Since the person is walking west, in the negative direction, we write her velocity with respect to the train as\n\n${vâ}_{\\text{PT}}=â2\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}i^\\text{.}{vâ}_{\\text{PT}}=â2\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}i^\\text{.}$\n\nWe can add the two velocity vectors to find the velocity of the person with respect to Earth. This\n\nrelative velocity\n\nis written as\n\n${vâ}_{\\text{PE}}={vâ}_{\\text{PT}}+{vâ}_{\\text{TE}}.{vâ}_{\\text{PE}}={vâ}_{\\text{PT}}+{vâ}_{\\text{TE}}.$\n\n4.33\n\nNote the ordering of the subscripts for the various reference frames in\n\nEquation 4.33\n\n. The subscripts for the coupling reference frame, which is the train, appear consecutively in the right-hand side of the equation.\n\nFigure 4.24\n\nshows the correct order of subscripts when forming the vector equation.\n\nFigure\n\n4.24\n\nWhen constructing the vector equation, the subscripts for the coupling reference frame appear consecutively on the inside. The subscripts on the left-hand side of the equation are the same as the two outside subscripts on the right-hand side of the equation.\n\nAdding the vectors, we find\n\n${vâ}_{\\text{PE}}=8\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}i^\\text{,}{vâ}_{\\text{PE}}=8\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}i^\\text{,}$\n\nso the person is moving 8 m/s east with respect to Earth. Graphically, this is shown in\n\nFigure 4.25\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n4.25\n\nVelocity vectors of the train with respect to Earth, person with respect to the train, and person with respect to Earth.\n\nRelative Velocity in Two Dimensions\n\nWe can now apply these concepts to describing motion in two dimensions. Consider a particle\n\nP\n\nand reference frames\n\nS\n\nand\n\n${S}^{â²},{S}^{â²},$\n\nas shown in\n\nFigure 4.26\n\n.

Therefore,\n\n${vâ}_{PS}={vâ}_{P{S}^{â²}}+{vâ}_{{S}^{â²}S}.{vâ}_{PS}={vâ}_{P{S}^{â²}}+{vâ}_{{S}^{â²}S}.$\n\n4.35\n\nThe velocity of a particle relative to S is equal to its velocity relative to\n\n${S}^{â²}{S}^{â²}$\n\nplus the velocity of\n\n${S}^{â²}{S}^{â²}$\n\nrelative to S\n\n.\n\nWe can extend\n\nEquation 4.35\n\nto any number of reference frames. For particle\n\nP\n\nwith velocities\n\n${vâ}_{PA},{vâ}_{PB}\\text{,}\\text{and}{vâ}_{PC}{vâ}_{PA},{vâ}_{PB}\\text{,}\\text{and}{vâ}_{PC}$\n\nin frames\n\nA\n\n,\n\nB\n\n, and\n\nC\n\n,\n\n${vâ}_{PC}={vâ}_{PA}+{vâ}_{AB}+{vâ}_{BC}.{vâ}_{PC}={vâ}_{PA}+{vâ}_{AB}+{vâ}_{BC}.$\n\n4.36\n\nWe can also see how the accelerations are related as observed in two reference frames by differentiating\n\nEquation 4.35\n\n:\n\n${aâ}_{PS}={aâ}_{P{S}^{â²}}+{aâ}_{{S}^{â²}S}.{aâ}_{PS}={aâ}_{P{S}^{â²}}+{aâ}_{{S}^{â²}S}.$\n\n4.37\n\nWe see that if the velocity of\n\n${S}^{â²}{S}^{â²}$\n\nrelative to\n\nS\n\nis a constant, then\n\n${aâ}_{{S}^{â²}S}=0{aâ}_{{S}^{â²}S}=0$\n\nand\n\n${aâ}_{PS}={aâ}_{P{S}^{â²}}.{aâ}_{PS}={aâ}_{P{S}^{â²}}.$\n\n4.38\n\nThis says the acceleration of a particle is the same as measured by two observers moving at a constant velocity relative to each other.\n\nExample\n\n4.13\n\nMotion of a Car Relative to a Truck\n\nA truck is traveling south at a speed of 70 km/h toward an intersection. A car is traveling east toward the intersection at a speed of 80 km/h (\n\nFigure 4.27\n\n). What is the velocity of the car relative to the truck?\n\nFigure\n\n4.27\n\nA car travels east toward an intersection while a truck travels south toward the same intersection.\n\nStrategy\n\nFirst, we must establish the reference frame common to both vehicles, which is Earth. Then, we write the velocities of each with respect to the reference frame of Earth, which enables us to form a vector equation that links the car, the truck, and Earth to solve for the velocity of the car with respect to the truck.\n\nSolution\n\nThe velocity of the car with respect to Earth is\n\n${vâ}_{\\text{CE}}=80\\text{km}\\text{/}\\text{h}i^.{vâ}_{\\text{CE}}=80\\text{km}\\text{/}\\text{h}i^.$\n\nThe velocity of the truck with respect to Earth is\n\n${vâ}_{\\text{TE}}=â70\\text{km}\\text{/}\\text{h}j^\\text{.}{vâ}_{\\text{TE}}=â70\\text{km}\\text{/}\\text{h}j^\\text{.}$\n\nUsing the velocity addition rule, the relative motion equation we are seeking is\n\n${vâ}_{\\text{CT}}={vâ}_{\\text{CE}}+{vâ}_{\\text{ET}}.{vâ}_{\\text{CT}}={vâ}_{\\text{CE}}+{vâ}_{\\text{ET}}.$\n\nHere,\n\n${vâ}_{\\text{CT}}{vâ}_{\\text{CT}}$\n\nis the velocity of the car with respect to the truck, and Earth is the connecting reference frame.

What is the velocity of the boat with respect to Earth?\n\nExample\n\n4.14\n\nFlying a Plane in a Wind\n\nA pilot must fly a plane due north to reach their destination. The plane can fly at 300 km/h in still air. A wind is blowing out of the northeast at 90 km/h. (a) In what direction must the pilot head the plane to fly due north? (b) What is the speed of the plane relative to the ground?\n\nStrategy\n\nThe pilot must point the plane somewhat east of north to compensate for the wind velocity. We need to construct a vector equation that contains the velocity of the plane with respect to the ground, the velocity of the plane with respect to the air, and the velocity of the air with respect to the ground. Since these last two quantities are known, we can solve for the velocity of the plane with respect to the ground. We can graph the vectors and use this diagram to evaluate the magnitude of the planeâs velocity with respect to the ground. The diagram will also tell us the angle the planeâs velocity makes with north with respect to the air, which is the direction the pilot must head the plane.\n\nSolution\n\nThe vector equation is\n\n${vâ}_{\\text{PG}}={vâ}_{\\text{PA}}+{vâ}_{\\text{AG}},{vâ}_{\\text{PG}}={vâ}_{\\text{PA}}+{vâ}_{\\text{AG}},$\n\nwhere P = plane, A = air, and G = ground.

Based in Lincolnshire, England, they perform precision flying shows at high speeds, which requires accurate measurement of position, velocity, and acceleration in three dimensions. (credit: modification of work by Phil Long)\n\nChapter Outline\n\n4.1\n\nDisplacement and Velocity Vectors\n\n4.2\n\nAcceleration Vector\n\n4.3\n\nProjectile Motion\n\n4.4\n\nUniform and Nonuniform Circular Motion\n\n4.5\n\nRelative Motion in One and Two Dimensions\n\nTo give a complete description of kinematics, we must explore motion in two and three dimensions. After all, most objects in our universe do not move in straight lines; rather, they follow curved paths. From kicked footballs to the flight paths of birds to the orbital motions of celestial bodies and down to the flow of blood plasma in your veins, most motion follows curved trajectories.\n\nFortunately, the treatment of motion in one dimension in the previous chapter has given us a foundation on which to build, as the concepts of position, displacement, velocity, and acceleration defined in one dimension can be expanded to two and three dimensions. Consider the Red Arrows, also known as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic team of the United Kingdom. Each jet follows a unique curved trajectory in three-dimensional airspace, as well as has a unique velocity and acceleration. Thus, to describe the motion of any of the jets accurately, we must assign to each jet a unique position vector in three dimensions as well as a unique velocity and acceleration vector. We can apply the same basic equations for displacement, velocity, and acceleration we derived in\n\nMotion Along a Straight Line\n\nto describe the motion of the jets in two and three dimensions, but with some modificationsâin particular, the inclusion of vectors.\n\nIn this chapter we also explore two special types of motion in two dimensions: projectile motion and circular motion. Last, we conclude with a discussion of relative motion. In the chapter-opening picture, each jet has a relative motion with respect to any other jet in the group or to the people observing the air show on the ground."

Instantaneous acceleration is a vector in two or three dimensions. It is found by taking the derivative of the velocity function with respect to time.\n\nIn three dimensions, acceleration\n\n$aâ(t)aâ(t)$\n\ncan be written as a vector sum of the one-dimensional accelerations\n\n${a}_{x}(t),{a}_{y}(t),\\text{and}{a}_{z}(t){a}_{x}(t),{a}_{y}(t),\\text{and}{a}_{z}(t)$\n\nalong the\n\nx-\n\n,\n\ny\n\n-, and\n\nz-\n\naxes.\n\nThe kinematic equations for constant acceleration can be written as the vector sum of the constant acceleration equations in the\n\nx\n\n,\n\ny\n\n, and\n\nz\n\ndirections.\n\n4.3\n\nProjectile Motion\n\nProjectile motion is the motion of an object subject only to the acceleration of gravity, where the acceleration is constant, as near the surface of Earth.\n\nTo solve projectile motion problems, we analyze the motion of the projectile in the horizontal and vertical directions using the one-dimensional kinematic equations for\n\nx\n\nand\n\ny\n\n.\n\nThe time of flight of a projectile launched with initial vertical velocity\n\n${v}_{0y}{v}_{0y}$\n\non an even surface is given by\n\n${T}_{tof}=\\frac{2({v}_{0}\\text{sin}Î¸)}{g}.{T}_{tof}=\\frac{2({v}_{0}\\text{sin}Î¸)}{g}.$\n\nThis equation is valid only when the projectile lands at the same elevation from which it was launched.\n\nThe maximum horizontal distance traveled by a projectile is called the range. Again, the equation for range is valid only when the projectile lands at the same elevation from which it was launched.\n\n4.4\n\nUniform and Nonuniform Circular Motion\n\nUniform circular motion is motion in a circle at constant speed.\n\nCentripetal acceleration\n\n${aâ}_{\\text{C}}{aâ}_{\\text{C}}$\n\nis the acceleration a particle must have to follow a circular path. Centripetal acceleration always points toward the center of rotation and has magnitude\n\n${a}_{\\text{C}}={v}^{2}\\text{/}r.{a}_{\\text{C}}={v}^{2}\\text{/}r.$\n\nNonuniform circular motion occurs when there is tangential acceleration of an object executing circular motion such that the speed of the object is changing. This acceleration is called tangential acceleration\n\n${aâ}_{\\text{T}}.{aâ}_{\\text{T}}.$\n\nThe magnitude of tangential acceleration is the time rate of change of the magnitude of the velocity. The tangential acceleration vector is tangential to the circle, whereas the centripetal acceleration vector points radially inward toward the center of the circle. The total acceleration is the vector sum of tangential and centripetal accelerations.\n\nAn object executing uniform circular motion can be described with equations of motion. The position vector of the object is\n\n$râ(t)=A\\text{cos}Ïti^+A\\text{sin}Ïtj^,râ(t)=A\\text{cos}Ïti^+A\\text{sin}Ïtj^,$\n\nwhere\n\nA\n\nis the magnitude\n\n$|râ(t)|,|râ(t)|,$\n\nwhich is also the radius of the circle, and\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\nis the angular frequency.\n\n4.5\n\nRelative Motion in One and Two Dimensions\n\nWhen analyzing motion of an object, the reference frame in terms of position, velocity, and acceleration needs to be specified.\n\nRelative velocity is the velocity of an object as observed from a particular reference frame, and it varies with the choice of reference frame.\n\nIf\n\nS\n\nand\n\n${S}^{â²}{S}^{â²}$\n\nare two reference frames moving relative to each other at a constant velocity, then the velocity of an object relative to\n\nS\n\nis equal to its velocity relative to\n\n${S}^{â²}{S}^{â²}$\n\nplus the velocity of\n\n${S}^{â²}{S}^{â²}$\n\nrelative to\n\nS.\n\nIf two reference frames are moving relative to each other at a constant velocity, then the accelerations of an object as observed in both reference frames are equal."

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nDistinguish between kinematics and dynamics\n\nUnderstand the definition of force\n\nIdentify simple free-body diagrams\n\nDefine the SI unit of force, the newton\n\nDescribe force as a vector\n\nThe study of motion is called\n\nkinematics\n\n, but kinematics only describes the way objects moveâtheir velocity and their acceleration.\n\nDynamics\n\nis the study of how forces affect the motion of objects and systems. It considers the causes of motion of objects and systems of interest, where a system is anything being analyzed. The foundation of\n\ndynamics\n\nare the laws of motion stated by Isaac\n\nNewton\n\n(1642â1727). These laws provide an example of the breadth and simplicity of principles under which nature functions. They are also universal laws in that they apply to situations on Earth and in space.\n\nNewtonâs laws of motion were just one part of the monumental work that has made him legendary (\n\nFigure 5.2\n\n). The development of Newtonâs laws marks the transition from the Renaissance to the modern era. Not until the advent of modern physics was it discovered that Newtonâs laws produce a good description of motion only when the objects are moving at speeds much less than the speed of light and when those objects are larger than the size of most molecules (about\n\n${10}^{â9}{10}^{â9}$\n\nm in diameter). These constraints define the realm of Newtonian mechanics. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein (1879â1955) developed the theory of relativity and, along with many other scientists, quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics does not have the constraints present in Newtonian physics. All of the situations we consider in this chapter, and all those preceding the introduction of relativity in\n\nRelativity\n\n, are in the realm of Newtonian physics.\n\nFigure\n\n5.2\n\nIsaac Newton (1642â1727) published his amazing work,\n\nPhilosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\n\n, in 1687. It proposed scientific laws that still apply today to describe the motion of objects (the laws of motion). Newton also discovered the law of gravity, invented calculus, and made great contributions to the theories of light and color.\n\nWorking Definition of Force\n\nDynamics is the study of the forces that cause objects and systems to move. To understand this, we need a working definition of force. An intuitive definition of\n\nforce\n\nâthat is, a push or a pullâis a good place to start. We know that a push or a pull has both magnitude and direction (therefore, it is a vector quantity), so we can define force as the push or pull on an object with a specific magnitude and direction. Force can be represented by vectors or expressed as a multiple of a standard force.\n\nThe push or pull on an object can vary considerably in either magnitude or direction. For example, a cannon exerts a strong force on a cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, Earth exerts only a tiny downward pull on a flea. Our everyday experiences also give us a good idea of how multiple forces add. If two people push in different directions on a third person, as illustrated in\n\nFigure 5.3\n\n, we might expect the total force to be in the direction shown. Since force is a vector, it adds just like other vectors. Forces, like other vectors, are represented by arrows and can be added using the familiar head-to-tail method or trigonometric methods. These ideas were developed in\n\nVectors\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n5.3\n\n(a) An overhead view of two ice skaters pushing on a third skater. Forces are vectors and add like other vectors, so the total force on the third skater is in the direction shown. (b) A free-body diagram representing the forces acting on the third skater.\n\nFigure 5.3\n\n(b) is our first example of a\n\nfree-body diagram\n\n, which is a sketch showing all external forces acting on an object or system. The object or system is represented by a single isolated point (or free body), and only those forces acting\n\non\n\nit that originate outside of the object or systemâthat is,\n\nexternal force\n\ns\n\nâare shown. (These forces are the only ones shown because only external forces acting on the free body affect its motion. We can ignore any internal forces within the body.) The forces are represented by vectors extending outward from the free body.\n\nFree-body diagrams are useful in analyzing forces acting on an object or system, and are employed extensively in the study and application of Newtonâs laws of motion. You will see them throughout this text and in all your studies of physics. The following steps briefly explain how a free-body diagram is created; we examine this strategy in more detail in\n\nDrawing Free-Body Diagrams\n\n.\n\nProblem-Solving Strategy\n\nDrawing Free-Body Diagrams\n\nDraw the object under consideration. If you are treating the object as a particle, represent the object as a point. Place this point at the origin of an\n\nxy\n\n-coordinate system.\n\nInclude all forces that act on the object, representing these forces as vectors. However, do not include the net force on the object or the forces that the object exerts on its environment.\n\nResolve all force vectors into\n\nx\n\n- and\n\ny\n\n-components.\n\nDraw a separate free-body diagram for each object in the problem.\n\nWe illustrate this strategy with two examples of free-body diagrams (\n\nFigure 5.4\n\n). The terms used in this figure are explained in more detail later in the chapter.\n\nFigure\n\n5.4\n\nIn these free-body diagrams,\n\n$NâNâ$\n\nis the normal force,\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nis the weight of the object, and\n\n$fâfâ$\n\nis the friction.\n\nThe steps given here are sufficient to guide you in this important problem-solving strategy. The final section of this chapter explains in more detail how to draw free-body diagrams when working with the ideas presented in this chapter.\n\nDevelopment of the Force Concept\n\nA quantitative definition of force can be based on some standard force, just as distance is measured in units relative to a standard length. One possibility is to stretch a spring a certain fixed distance (\n\nFigure 5.5\n\n) and use the force it exerts to pull itself back to its relaxed shapeâcalled a\n\nrestoring force\n\nâas a standard. The magnitude of all other forces can be considered as multiples of this standard unit of force. Many other possibilities exist for standard forces. Some alternative definitions of force will be given later in this chapter.\n\nFigure\n\n5.5\n\nThe force exerted by a stretched spring can be used as a standard unit of force. (a) This spring has a length\n\nx\n\nwhen undistorted. (b) When stretched a distance\n\n$\\text{Î}x\\text{Î}x$\n\n, the spring exerts a restoring force\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{restore}},{Fâ}_{\\text{restore}},$\n\nwhich is reproducible. (c) A spring scale is one device that uses a spring to measure force. The force\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{restore}}{Fâ}_{\\text{restore}}$\n\nis exerted on whatever is attached to the hook. Here, this force has a magnitude of six units of the force standard being employed.\n\nLetâs analyze force more deeply. Suppose a physics student sits at a table, working diligently on his homework (\n\nFigure 5.6\n\n). What external forces act on him? Can we determine the origin of these forces?\n\nFigure\n\n5.6\n\n(a) The forces acting on the student are due to the chair, the table, the floor, and Earthâs gravitational attraction. (b) In solving a problem involving the student, we may want to consider only the forces acting along the line running through his torso. A free-body diagram for this situation is shown.\n\nIn most situations, forces are grouped into two categories:\n\ncontact forces\n\nand\n\nfield forces\n\n. As you might guess, contact forces are due to direct physical contact between objects. For example, the student in\n\nFigure 5.6\n\nexperiences the contact forces\n\n$CâCâ$\n\n,\n\n$FâFâ$\n\n, and\n\n$TâTâ$\n\n, which are exerted by the chair on his posterior, the floor on his feet, and the table on his forearms, respectively. Field forces, however, act without the necessity of physical contact between objects. They depend on the presence of a âfieldâ in the region of space surrounding the body under consideration. Since the student is in Earthâs gravitational field, he feels a gravitational force\n\n$wâwâ$\n\n; in other words, he has weight.\n\nYou can think of a field as a property of space that is detectable by the forces it exerts. Scientists think there are only four fundamental force fields in nature. These are the gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak fields (we consider these four forces in nature later in this text). As noted for\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nin\n\nFigure 5.6\n\n, the gravitational field is responsible for the weight of a body. The forces of the electromagnetic field include those of static electricity and magnetism; they are also responsible for the attraction among atoms in bulk matter. Both the strong nuclear and the weak force fields are effective only over distances roughly equal to a length of scale no larger than an atomic nucleus (\n\n${10}^{â15}\\text{m}{10}^{â15}\\text{m}$\n\n). Their range is so small that neither field has influence in the macroscopic world of Newtonian mechanics.\n\nContact forces are fundamentally electromagnetic. While the elbow of the student in\n\nFigure 5.6\n\nis in contact with the tabletop, the atomic charges in his skin interact electromagnetically with the charges in the surface of the table. The net (total) result is the force\n\n$TâTâ$\n\n. Similarly, when adhesive tape sticks to a piece of paper, the atoms of the tape are intermingled with those of the paper to cause a net electromagnetic force between the two objects. However, in the context of Newtonian mechanics, the electromagnetic origin of contact forces is not an important concern.\n\nVector Notation for Force\n\nAs previously discussed, force is a vector; it has both magnitude and direction. The SI unit of force is called the\n\nnewton\n\n(abbreviated N), and 1 N is the force needed to accelerate an object with a mass of 1 kg at a rate of\n\n$1{\\text{m/s}}^{2}1{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n:\n\n$1\\text{N}=1\\text{kg}Â·{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.1\\text{N}=1\\text{kg}Â·{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.$\n\nAn easy way to remember the size of a newton is to imagine holding a small apple; it has a weight of about 1 N.\n\nWe can thus describe a two-dimensional force in the form\n\n$Fâ=ai^+bj^Fâ=ai^+bj^$\n\n(the unit vectors\n\n$i^\\text{and}j^i^\\text{and}j^$\n\nindicate the direction of these forces along the\n\nx\n\n-axis and the\n\ny\n\n-axis, respectively) and a three-dimensional force in the form\n\n$Fâ=ai^+bj^+ck^.Fâ=ai^+bj^+ck^.$\n\nIn\n\nFigure 5.3\n\n, letâs suppose that ice skater 1, on the left side of the figure, pushes horizontally with a force of 30.0 N to the right; we represent this as\n\n${Fâ}_{1}=30.0i^\\text{N}.{Fâ}_{1}=30.0i^\\text{N}.$\n\nSimilarly, if ice skater 2 pushes with a force of 40.0 N in the positive vertical direction shown, we would write\n\n${Fâ}_{2}=40.0j^\\text{N}.{Fâ}_{2}=40.0j^\\text{N}.$\n\nThe resultant of the two forces causes a mass to accelerateâin this case, the third ice skater. This resultant is called the\n\nnet external force\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}$\n\nand is found by taking the vector sum of all external forces acting on an object or system (thus, we can also represent net external force as\n\n$âFââFâ$\n\n):\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=âFâ={Fâ}_{1}+{Fâ}_{2}+\\text{â¯}{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=âFâ={Fâ}_{1}+{Fâ}_{2}+\\text{â¯}$\n\n5.1\n\nThis equation can be extended to any number of forces.\n\nIn this example, we have\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=âFâ={Fâ}_{1}+{Fâ}_{2}=30.0i^+40.0j^\\text{N}{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=âFâ={Fâ}_{1}+{Fâ}_{2}=30.0i^+40.0j^\\text{N}$\n\n. The hypotenuse of the triangle shown in\n\nFigure 5.3\n\nis the resultant force, or net force. It is a vector. To find its magnitude (the size of the vector, without regard to direction), we use the rule given in\n\nVectors\n\n, taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the components:\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=\\sqrt{{(30.0\\text{N})}^{2}+{(40.0\\text{N})}^{2}}=50.0\\text{N}.{F}_{\\text{net}}=\\sqrt{{(30.0\\text{N})}^{2}+{(40.0\\text{N})}^{2}}=50.0\\text{N}.$\n\nThe direction is given by\n\n$Î¸={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{{F}_{2}}{{F}_{1}})={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{40.0}{30.0})=53.1\\text{Â°},Î¸={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{{F}_{2}}{{F}_{1}})={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{40.0}{30.0})=53.1\\text{Â°},$\n\nmeasured from the positive\n\nx\n\n-axis, as shown in the free-body diagram in\n\nFigure 5.3\n\n(b).\n\nLetâs suppose the ice skaters now push the third ice skater with\n\n${Fâ}_{1}=3.0i^+8.0j^\\text{N}{Fâ}_{1}=3.0i^+8.0j^\\text{N}$\n\nand\n\n${Fâ}_{2}=5.0i^+4.0j^\\text{N}{Fâ}_{2}=5.0i^+4.0j^\\text{N}$\n\n. What is the resultant of these two forces? We must recognize that force is a vector; therefore, we must add using the rules for vector addition:\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}={Fâ}_{1}+{Fâ}_{2}=(3.0i^+8.0j^)+(5.0i^+4.0j^)=8.0i^+12j^\\text{N}{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}={Fâ}_{1}+{Fâ}_{2}=(3.0i^+8.0j^)+(5.0i^+4.0j^)=8.0i^+12j^\\text{N}$\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n5.1\n\nFind the magnitude and direction of the net force in the ice skater example just given.\n\nInteractive\n\nEngage the Phet simulation below to learn how to add vectors.

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nDescribe Newton's first law of motion\n\nRecognize friction as an external force\n\nDefine inertia\n\nIdentify inertial reference frames\n\nCalculate equilibrium for a system\n\nExperience suggests that an object at rest remains at rest if left alone and that an object in motion tends to slow down and stop unless some effort is made to keep it moving. However,\n\nNewtonâs first law\n\ngives a deeper explanation of this observation.\n\nNewtonâs First Law of Motion\n\nA body at rest remains at rest or, if in motion, remains in motion at constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force.\n\nNote the repeated use of the verb âremains.â We can think of this law as preserving the status quo of motion. Also note the expression âconstant velocity;â this means that the object maintains a path along a straight line, since neither the magnitude nor the direction of the velocity vector changes. We can use\n\nFigure 5.7\n\nto consider the two parts of Newtonâs first law.\n\nFigure\n\n5.7\n\n(a) A hockey puck is shown at rest; it remains at rest until an outside force such as a hockey stick changes its state of rest; (b) a hockey puck is shown in motion; it continues in motion in a straight line until an outside force causes it to change its state of motion. Although it is slick, an ice surface provides some friction that slows the puck.\n\nRather than contradicting our experience, Newtonâs first law says that there must be a cause for any change in velocity (a change in either magnitude or direction) to occur. This cause is a net external force, which we defined earlier in the chapter. An object sliding across a table or floor slows down due to the net force of friction acting on the object. If friction disappears, will the object still slow down?\n\nThe idea of cause and effect is crucial in accurately describing what happens in various situations. For example, consider what happens to an object sliding along a rough horizontal surface. The object quickly grinds to a halt. If we spray the surface with talcum powder to make the surface smoother, the object slides farther. If we make the surface even smoother by rubbing lubricating oil on it, the object slides farther yet. Extrapolating to a frictionless surface and ignoring air resistance, we can imagine the object sliding in a straight line indefinitely. Friction is thus the cause of slowing (consistent with Newtonâs first law). The object would not slow down if friction were eliminated.\n\nConsider an air hockey table (\n\nFigure 5.8\n\n). When the air is turned off, the puck slides only a short distance before friction slows it to a stop. However, when the air is turned on, it creates a nearly frictionless surface, and the puck glides long distances without slowing down. Additionally, if we know enough about the friction, we can accurately predict how quickly the object slows down.\n\nFigure\n\n5.8\n\nAn air hockey table is useful in illustrating Newtonâs laws. When the air is off, friction quickly slows the puck; but when the air is on, it minimizes contact between the puck and the hockey table, and the puck glides far down the table.\n\nNewtonâs first law is general and can be applied to anything from an object sliding on a table to a satellite in orbit to blood pumped from the heart. Experiments have verified that any change in velocity (speed or direction) must be caused by an external force. The idea of\n\ngenerally applicable or universal laws\n\nis importantâit is a basic feature of all laws of physics. Identifying these laws is like recognizing patterns in nature from which further patterns can be discovered. The genius of Galileo, who first developed the idea for the first law of motion, and Newton, who clarified it, was to ask the fundamental question: âWhat is the cause?â Thinking in terms of cause and effect is fundamentally different from the typical ancient Greek approach, when questions such as âWhy does a tiger have stripes?â would have been answered in Aristotelian fashion, such as âThat is the nature of the beast.â The ability to think in terms of cause and effect is the ability to make a connection between an observed behavior and the surrounding world.\n\nGravitation and Inertia\n\nRegardless of the scale of an object, whether a molecule or a subatomic particle, two properties remain valid and thus of interest to physics: gravitation and inertia. Both are connected to mass. Roughly speaking,\n\nmass\n\nis a measure of the amount of matter in something.\n\nGravitation\n\nis the attraction of one mass to another, such as the attraction between yourself and Earth that holds your feet to the floor. The magnitude of this attraction is your weight, and it is a force.\n\nMass is also related to\n\ninertia\n\n, the ability of an object to resist changes in its motionâin other words, to resist acceleration. Newtonâs first law is often called the\n\nlaw of inertia\n\n. As we know from experience, some objects have more inertia than others. It is more difficult to change the motion of a large boulder than that of a basketball, for example, because the boulder has more mass than the basketball. In other words, the inertia of an object is measured by its mass. The relationship between mass and weight is explored later in this chapter.\n\nInertial Reference Frames\n\nEarlier, we stated Newtonâs first law as âA body at rest remains at rest or, if in motion, remains in motion at constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force.â It can also be stated as âEvery body remains in its state of uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces acting on it.â To Newton, âuniform motion in a straight lineâ meant constant velocity, which includes the case of zero velocity, or rest. Therefore, the first law says that the velocity of an object remains constant if the net force on it is zero.\n\nNewtonâs first law is usually considered to be a statement about reference frames. It provides a method for identifying a special type of reference frame: the\n\ninertial reference frame\n\n. In principle, we can make the net force on a body zero. If its velocity relative to a given frame is constant, then that frame is said to be inertial. So by definition, an inertial reference frame is a reference frame in which Newtonâs first law is valid. Newtonâs first law applies to objects with constant velocity. From this fact, we can infer the following statement.\n\nInertial Reference Frame\n\nA reference frame moving at constant velocity relative to an inertial frame is also inertial. A reference frame accelerating relative to an inertial frame is not inertial.\n\nAre inertial frames common in nature? It turns out that well within experimental error, a reference frame at rest relative to the most distant, or âfixed,â stars is inertial. All frames moving uniformly with respect to this fixed-star frame are also inertial. For example, a nonrotating reference frame attached to the Sun is, for all practical purposes, inertial, because its velocity relative to the fixed stars does not vary by more than one part in\n\n${10}^{10}.{10}^{10}.$\n\nEarth accelerates relative to the fixed stars because it rotates on its axis and revolves around the Sun; hence, a reference frame attached to its surface is not inertial. For most problems, however, such a frame serves as a sufficiently accurate approximation to an inertial frame, because the acceleration of a point on Earthâs surface relative to the fixed stars is rather small (\n\n$<3.4Ã{10}^{â2}{\\text{m/s}}^{2}<3.4Ã{10}^{â2}{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n). Thus, unless indicated otherwise, we consider reference frames fixed on Earth to be inertial.\n\nFinally, no particular inertial frame is more special than any other. As far as the laws of nature are concerned, all inertial frames are equivalent. In analyzing a problem, we choose one inertial frame over another simply on the basis of convenience.\n\nNewtonâs First Law and Equilibrium\n\nNewtonâs first law tells us about the\n\nequilibrium\n\nof a system, which is the state in which the forces on the system are balanced. Returning to\n\nForces\n\nand the ice skaters in\n\nFigure 5.3\n\n, we know that the forces\n\n${Fâ}_{1}{Fâ}_{1}$\n\nand\n\n${Fâ}_{2}{Fâ}_{2}$\n\ncombine to form a resultant force, or the net external force:\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{R}}={Fâ}_{\\text{net}}={Fâ}_{1}+{Fâ}_{2}.{Fâ}_{\\text{R}}={Fâ}_{\\text{net}}={Fâ}_{1}+{Fâ}_{2}.$\n\nTo create equilibrium, we require a balancing force that will produce a net force of zero. This force must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{R}},{Fâ}_{\\text{R}},$\n\nwhich means the vector must be\n\n$\\text{â}{Fâ}_{\\text{R}}.\\text{â}{Fâ}_{\\text{R}}.$\n\nReferring to the ice skaters, for which we found\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{R}}{Fâ}_{\\text{R}}$\n\nto be\n\n$30.0i^+40.0j^\\text{N}30.0i^+40.0j^\\text{N}$\n\n, we can determine the balancing force by simply finding\n\n$\\text{â}{Fâ}_{\\text{R}}=â30.0i^â40.0j^\\text{N}.\\text{â}{Fâ}_{\\text{R}}=â30.0i^â40.0j^\\text{N}.$\n\nSee the free-body diagram in\n\nFigure 5.3\n\n(b).\n\nWe can give Newtonâs first law in vector form:\n\n$vâ=\\text{constant when}{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=0â\\text{N}.vâ=\\text{constant when}{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=0â\\text{N}.$\n\n5.2\n\nThis equation says that a net force of zero implies that the velocity\n\n$vâvâ$\n\nof the object is constant. (The word âconstantâ can indicate zero velocity.)\n\nNewtonâs first law is deceptively simple. If a car is at rest, the only forces acting on the car are weight and the contact force of the pavement pushing up on the car (\n\nFigure 5.9\n\n). It is easy to understand that a nonzero net force is required to change the state of motion of the car. As a car moves with constant velocity, the friction force propels the car forward and opposes the drag force against it.\n\nFigure\n\n5.9\n\nA car is shown (a) parked and (b) moving at constant velocity. How do Newtonâs laws apply to the parked car? What does the knowledge that the car is moving at constant velocity tell us about the net horizontal force on the car?\n\nExample\n\n5.1\n\nWhen Does Newtonâs First Law Apply to Your Car?\n\nNewtonâs laws can be applied to all physical processes involving force and motion, including something as mundane as driving a car.\n\n(a) Your car is parked outside your house. Does Newtonâs first law apply in this situation? Why or why not?\n\n(b) Your car moves at constant velocity down the street. Does Newtonâs first law apply in this situation? Why or why not?\n\nStrategy\n\nIn (a), we are considering the first part of Newtonâs first law, dealing with a body at rest; in (b), we look at the second part of Newtonâs first law for a body in motion.\n\nSolution\n\nWhen your car is parked, all forces on the car must be balanced; the vector sum is 0 N. Thus, the net force is zero, and Newtonâs first law applies. The acceleration of the car is zero, and in this case, the velocity is also zero.\n\nWhen your car is moving at constant velocity down the street, the net force must also be zero according to Newtonâs first law. The carâs frictional force between the road and tires opposes the drag force on the car with the same magnitude, producing a net force of zero. The body continues in its state of constant velocity until the net force becomes nonzero. Realize that\n\na net force of zero means that an object is either at rest or moving with constant velocity, that is, it is not accelerating.\n\nWhat do you suppose happens when the car accelerates? We explore this idea in the next section.\n\nSignificance\n\nAs this example shows, there are two kinds of equilibrium. In (a), the car is at rest; we say it is in\n\nstatic equilibrium\n\n. In (b), the forces on the car are balanced, but the car is moving; we say that it is in\n\ndynamic equilibrium\n\n. (We examine this idea in more detail in\n\nStatic Equilibrium and Elasticity\n\n.) Again, it is possible for two (or more) forces to act on an object yet for the object to move. In addition, a net force of zero cannot produce acceleration.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n5.2\n\nA skydiver opens their parachute, and shortly thereafter, they are moving at constant velocity.

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nDistinguish between external and internal forces\n\nDescribe Newton's second law of motion\n\nExplain the dependence of acceleration on net force and mass\n\nNewtonâs second law is closely related to his first law. It mathematically gives the cause-and-effect relationship between force and changes in motion. Newtonâs second law is quantitative and is used extensively to calculate what happens in situations involving a force. Before we can write down Newtonâs second law as a simple equation that gives the exact relationship of force, mass, and acceleration, we need to sharpen some ideas we mentioned earlier.\n\nForce and Acceleration\n\nFirst, what do we mean by a change in motion? The answer is that a change in motion is equivalent to a change in velocity. A change in velocity means, by definition, that there is acceleration. Newtonâs first law says that a net external force causes a change in motion; thus, we see that a\n\nnet external force causes nonzero acceleration\n\n.\n\nWe defined external force in\n\nForces\n\nas force acting on an object or system that originates outside of the object or system. Letâs consider this concept further. An intuitive notion of\n\nexternal\n\nis correctâit is outside the system of interest. For example, in\n\nFigure 5.10\n\n(a), the system of interest is the car plus the person within it. The two forces exerted by the two students are external forces. In contrast, an internal force acts between elements of the system. Thus, the force the person in the car exerts to hang on to the steering wheel is an internal force between elements of the system of interest. Only external forces affect the motion of a system, according to Newtonâs first law. (The internal forces cancel each other out, as explained in the next section.) Therefore, we must define the boundaries of the system before we can determine which forces are external. Sometimes, the system is obvious, whereas at other times, identifying the boundaries of a system is more subtle. The concept of a system is fundamental to many areas of physics, as is the correct application of Newtonâs laws. This concept is revisited many times in the study of physics.\n\nFigure\n\n5.10\n\nDifferent forces exerted on the same mass produce different accelerations. (a) Two students push a stalled car. All external forces acting on the car are shown. (b) The forces acting on the car are transferred to a coordinate plane (free-body diagram) for simpler analysis. (c) The tow truck can produce greater external force on the same mass, and thus greater acceleration.\n\nFrom this example, you can see that different forces exerted on the same mass produce different accelerations. In\n\nFigure 5.10\n\n(a), the two students push a car with a driver in it. Arrows representing all external forces are shown. The system of interest is the car and its driver. The weight\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nof the system and the support of the ground\n\n$NâNâ$\n\nare also shown for completeness and are assumed to cancel (because there was no vertical motion and no imbalance of forces in the vertical direction to create a change in motion). The vector\n\n$fâfâ$\n\nrepresents the friction acting on the car, and it acts to the left, opposing the motion of the car. (We discuss friction in more detail in the next chapter.) In\n\nFigure 5.10\n\n(b), all external forces acting on the system add together to produce the net force\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}.{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}.$\n\nThe free-body diagram shows all of the forces acting on the system of interest. The dot represents the center of mass of the system. Each force vector extends from this dot. Because there are two forces acting to the right, the vectors are shown collinearly. Finally, in\n\nFigure 5.10\n\n(c), a larger net external force produces a larger acceleration\n\n$({a}^{â²}â>aâ)({a}^{â²}â>aâ)$\n\nwhen the tow truck pulls the car.\n\nIt seems reasonable that acceleration would be directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external force acting on a system. This assumption has been verified experimentally and is illustrated in\n\nFigure 5.10\n\n. To obtain an equation for Newtonâs second law, we first write the relationship of acceleration\n\n$aâaâ$\n\nand net external force\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}$\n\nas the proportionality\n\n$aââ{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}aââ{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}$\n\nwhere the symbol\n\n$ââ$\n\nmeans âproportional to.â (Recall from\n\nForces\n\nthat the net external force is the vector sum of all external forces and is sometimes indicated as\n\n$âFâ.âFâ.$\n\n) This proportionality shows what we have said in wordsâacceleration is directly proportional to net external force. Once the system of interest is chosen, identify the external forces and ignore the internal ones. It is a tremendous simplification to disregard the numerous internal forces acting between objects within the system, such as muscular forces within the studentsâ bodies, let alone the myriad forces between the atoms in the objects. Still, this simplification helps us solve some complex problems.\n\nIt also seems reasonable that acceleration should be inversely proportional to the mass of the system. In other words, the larger the mass (the inertia), the smaller the acceleration produced by a given force. As illustrated in\n\nFigure 5.11\n\n, the same net external force applied to a basketball produces a much smaller acceleration when it is applied to an SUV. The proportionality is written as\n\n$aâ\\frac{1}{m},aâ\\frac{1}{m},$\n\nwhere\n\nm\n\nis the mass of the system and\n\na\n\nis the magnitude of the acceleration. Experiments have shown that acceleration is exactly inversely proportional to mass, just as it is directly proportional to net external force.\n\nFigure\n\n5.11\n\nThe same force exerted on systems of different masses produces different accelerations. (a) A basketball player pushes on a basketball to make a pass. (Ignore the effect of gravity on the ball.) (b) The same player exerts an identical force on a stalled SUV and produces far less acceleration. (c) The free-body diagrams are identical, permitting direct comparison of the two situations. A series of patterns for free-body diagrams will emerge as you do more problems and learn how to draw them in\n\nDrawing Free-Body Diagrams\n\n.\n\nIt has been found that the acceleration of an object depends only on the net external force and the mass of the object. Combining the two proportionalities just given yields\n\nNewtonâs second law\n\n.\n\nNewtonâs Second Law of Motion\n\nThe acceleration of a system is directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external force acting on the system and is inversely proportional to its mass. In equation form, Newtonâs second law is\n\n$aâ=\\frac{{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}}{m},aâ=\\frac{{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}}{m},$\n\nwhere\n\n$aâaâ$\n\nis the acceleration,\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}$\n\nis the net force, and\n\nm\n\nis the mass. This is often written in the more familiar form\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=âFâ=maâ,{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=âFâ=maâ,$\n\n5.3\n\nbut the first equation gives more insight into what Newtonâs second law means. When only the magnitude of force and acceleration are considered, this equation can be written in the simpler scalar form:\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=ma.{F}_{\\text{net}}=ma.$\n\n5.4\n\nThe law is a cause-and-effect relationship among three quantities that is not simply based on their definitions. The validity of the second law is based on experimental verification. The free-body diagram, which you will learn to draw in\n\nDrawing Free-Body Diagrams\n\n, is the basis for writing Newtonâs second law.\n\nExample\n\n5.2\n\nWhat Acceleration Can a Person Produce When Pushing a Lawn Mower?\n\nSuppose that the net external force (push minus friction) exerted on a lawn mower is 51 N (about 11 lb.) parallel to the ground (\n\nFigure 5.12\n\n). The mass of the mower is 24 kg. What is its acceleration?\n\nFigure\n\n5.12\n\n(a) The net force on a lawn mower is 51 N to the right. At what rate does the lawn mower accelerate to the right? (b) The free-body diagram for this problem is shown.\n\nStrategy\n\nThis problem involves only motion in the horizontal direction; we are also given the net force, indicated by the single vector, but we can suppress the vector nature and concentrate on applying Newtonâs second law. Since\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}{F}_{\\text{net}}$\n\nand\n\nm\n\nare given, the acceleration can be calculated directly from Newtonâs second law as\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=ma.{F}_{\\text{net}}=ma.$\n\nSolution\n\nThe magnitude of the acceleration\n\na\n\nis\n\n$a={F}_{\\text{net}}\\text{/}ma={F}_{\\text{net}}\\text{/}m$\n\n. Entering known values gives\n\n$a=\\frac{51\\text{N}}{24\\text{kg}}.a=\\frac{51\\text{N}}{24\\text{kg}}.$\n\nSubstituting the unit of kilograms times meters per square second for newtons yields\n\n$a=\\frac{51\\text{kg}Â·{\\text{m/s}}^{2}}{24\\text{kg}}=2.1{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.a=\\frac{51\\text{kg}Â·{\\text{m/s}}^{2}}{24\\text{kg}}=2.1{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.$\n\nSignificance\n\nThe direction of the acceleration is the same direction as that of the net force, which is parallel to the ground. This is a result of the vector relationship expressed in Newtonâs second law, that is, the vector representing net force is the scalar multiple of the acceleration vector. There is no information given in this example about the individual external forces acting on the system, but we can say something about their relative magnitudes. For example, the force exerted by the person pushing the mower must be greater than the friction opposing the motion (since we know the mower moved forward), and the vertical forces must cancel because no acceleration occurs in the vertical direction (the mower is moving only horizontally). The acceleration found is small enough to be reasonable for a person pushing a mower. Such an effort would not last too long, because the personâs top speed would soon be reached.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n5.3\n\nAt the time of its launch, the HMS\n\nTitanic\n\nwas the most massive mobile object ever built, with a mass of\n\n$6.0Ã{10}^{7}\\text{kg}6.0Ã{10}^{7}\\text{kg}$\n\n. If a force of 6 MN\n\n$(6Ã{10}^{6}\\text{N})(6Ã{10}^{6}\\text{N})$\n\nwas applied to the ship, what acceleration would it experience?\n\nIn the preceding example, we dealt with net force only for simplicity. However, several forces act on the lawn mower. The weight\n\n$wâwâ$\n\n(discussed in detail in\n\nMass and Weight\n\n) pulls down on the mower, toward the center of Earth; this produces a contact force on the ground. The ground must exert an upward force on the lawn mower, known as the normal force\n\n$NâNâ$\n\n, which we define in\n\nCommon Forces\n\n. These forces are balanced and therefore do not produce vertical acceleration. In the next example, we show both of these forces. As you continue to solve problems using Newtonâs second law, be sure to show multiple forces.\n\nExample\n\n5.3\n\nWhich Force Is Bigger?\n\n(a) The car shown in\n\nFigure 5.13\n\nis moving at a constant speed. Which force is bigger,\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{friction}}{Fâ}_{\\text{friction}}$\n\nor\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{drag}}{Fâ}_{\\text{drag}}$\n\n? Explain.\n\n(b) The same car is now accelerating to the right. Which force is bigger,\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{friction}}{Fâ}_{\\text{friction}}$\n\nor\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{drag}}?{Fâ}_{\\text{drag}}?$\n\nExplain.\n\nFigure\n\n5.13\n\nA car is shown (a) moving at constant speed and (b) accelerating. How do the forces acting on the car compare in each case? (a) What does the knowledge that the car is moving at constant velocity tell us about the net horizontal force on the car compared to the friction force? (b) What does the knowledge that the car is accelerating tell us about the horizontal force on the car compared to the friction force?\n\nStrategy\n\nWe must consider Newtonâs first and second laws to analyze the situation. We need to decide which law applies; this, in turn, will tell us about the relationship between the forces.\n\nSolution\n\nThe forces are equal. According to Newtonâs first law, if the net force is zero, the velocity is constant.\n\nIn this case,\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{friction}}{Fâ}_{\\text{friction}}$\n\nmust be larger than\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{drag}}.{Fâ}_{\\text{drag}}.$\n\nAccording to Newtonâs second law, a net force is required to cause acceleration.\n\nSignificance\n\nThese questions may seem trivial, but they are commonly answered incorrectly. For a car or any other object to move, it must be accelerated from rest to the desired speed; this requires that the friction force be greater than the drag force. Once the car is moving at constant velocity, the net force must be zero; otherwise, the car will accelerate (gain speed). To solve problems involving Newtonâs laws, we must understand whether to apply Newtonâs first law (where\n\n$âFâ=0ââFâ=0â$\n\n) or Newtonâs second law (where\n\n$âFââFâ$\n\nis not zero). This will be apparent as you see more examples and attempt to solve problems on your own.\n\nExample\n\n5.4\n\nWhat Rocket Thrust Accelerates This Sled?\n\nBefore space flights carrying astronauts, rocket sleds were used to test aircraft, missile equipment, and physiological effects on human subjects at high speeds. They consisted of a platform that was mounted on one or two rails and propelled by several rockets.\n\nCalculate the magnitude of force exerted by each rocket, called its thrust\n\nT\n\n, for the four-rocket propulsion system shown in\n\nFigure 5.14\n\n. The sledâs initial acceleration is\n\n$49{\\text{m/s}}^{2}49{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n, the mass of the system is 2100 kg, and the force of friction opposing the motion is 650 N.\n\nFigure\n\n5.14\n\nA sled experiences a rocket thrust that accelerates it to the right. Each rocket creates an identical thrust\n\nT\n\n. The system here is the sled, its rockets, and its rider, so none of the forces between these objects are considered. The arrow representing friction\n\n$(fâ)(fâ)$\n\nis drawn larger than scale.\n\nStrategy\n\nAlthough forces are acting both vertically and horizontally, we assume the vertical forces cancel because there is no vertical acceleration. This leaves us with only horizontal forces and a simpler one-dimensional problem. Directions are indicated with plus or minus signs, with right taken as the positive direction. See the free-body diagram in\n\nFigure 5.14\n\n.\n\nSolution\n\nSince acceleration, mass, and the force of friction are given, we start with Newtonâs second law and look for ways to find the thrust of the engines. We have defined the direction of the force and acceleration as acting âto the right,â so we need to consider only the magnitudes of these quantities in the calculations. Hence we begin with\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=ma{F}_{\\text{net}}=ma$\n\nwhere\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}{F}_{\\text{net}}$\n\nis the net force along the horizontal direction. We can see from the figure that the engine thrusts add, whereas friction opposes the thrust. In equation form, the net external force is\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=4Tâf.{F}_{\\text{net}}=4Tâf.$\n\nSubstituting this into Newtonâs second law gives us\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=ma=4Tâf.{F}_{\\text{net}}=ma=4Tâf.$\n\nUsing a little algebra, we solve for the total thrust 4\n\nT\n\n:\n\n$4T=ma+f.4T=ma+f.$\n\nSubstituting known values yields\n\n$4T=ma+f=(2100\\text{kg})(49{\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}}^{2})+650\\text{N}.4T=ma+f=(2100\\text{kg})(49{\\text{m}\\text{/}\\text{s}}^{2})+650\\text{N}.$\n\nTherefore, the total thrust is\n\n$4T=1.0Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N},4T=1.0Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N},$\n\nand the individual thrusts are\n\n$T=\\frac{1.0Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N}}{4}=2.5Ã{10}^{4}\\text{N}.T=\\frac{1.0Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N}}{4}=2.5Ã{10}^{4}\\text{N}.$\n\nSignificance\n\nThe numbers are quite large, so the result might surprise you. Experiments such as this were performed in the early 1960s to test the limits of human endurance, and the setup was designed to protect human subjects in jet fighter emergency ejections. Speeds of 1000 km/h were obtained, with accelerations of 45\n\ng\n\nâs. (Recall that\n\ng\n\n, acceleration due to gravity, is\n\n$9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2}9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n. When we say that acceleration is 45\n\ng\n\nâs, it is\n\n$45Ã9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2},45Ã9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2},$\n\nwhich is approximately\n\n$440{\\text{m/s}}^{2}440{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n.) Although living subjects are not used anymore, land speeds of 10,000 km/h have been obtained with a rocket sled.\n\nIn this example, as in the preceding one, the system of interest is obvious. We see in later examples that choosing the system of interest is crucialâand the choice is not always obvious.\n\nNewtonâs second law is more than a definition; it is a relationship among acceleration, force, and mass. It can help us make predictions. Each of those physical quantities can be defined independently, so the second law tells us something basic and universal about nature.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n5.4\n\nA 550-kg sports car collides with a 2200-kg truck, and during the collision, the net force on each vehicle is the force exerted by the other. If the magnitude of the truckâs acceleration is\n\n$10{\\text{m/s}}^{2},10{\\text{m/s}}^{2},$\n\nwhat is the magnitude of the sports carâs acceleration?\n\nComponent Form of Newtonâs Second Law\n\nWe have developed Newtonâs second law and presented it as a vector equation in\n\nEquation 5.3\n\n. This vector equation can be written as three component equations:\n\n$â{F}_{x}=m{a}_{x},â{F}_{y}=m{a}_{y},\\text{and}â{F}_{z}=m{a}_{z}.â{F}_{x}=m{a}_{x},â{F}_{y}=m{a}_{y},\\text{and}â{F}_{z}=m{a}_{z}.$\n\n5.5\n\nThe second law is a description of how a body responds mechanically to its environment. The influence of the environment is the net force\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}},{Fâ}_{\\text{net}},$\n\nthe bodyâs response is the acceleration\n\n$aâ,aâ,$\n\nand the strength of the response is inversely proportional to the mass\n\nm\n\n. The larger the mass of an object, the smaller its response (its acceleration) to the influence of the environment (a given net force). Therefore, a bodyâs mass is a measure of its inertia, as we explained in\n\nNewtonâs First Law\n\n.\n\nExample\n\n5.5\n\nForce on a Soccer Ball\n\nA 0.400-kg soccer ball is kicked across the field by a player; it undergoes acceleration given by\n\n$aâ=3.00i^+7.00j^{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.aâ=3.00i^+7.00j^{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.$\n\nFind (a) the resultant force acting on the ball and (b) the magnitude and direction of the resultant force.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe vectors in\n\n$i^i^$\n\nand\n\n$j^j^$\n\nformat, which indicate force direction along the\n\nx\n\n-axis and the\n\ny\n\n-axis, respectively, are involved, so we apply Newtonâs second law in vector form.\n\nSolution\n\nWe apply Newtonâs second law:\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=maâ=(0.400\\text{kg})(3.00i^+7.00j^{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=1.20i^+2.80j^\\text{N}.{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=maâ=(0.400\\text{kg})(3.00i^+7.00j^{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=1.20i^+2.80j^\\text{N}.$\n\nMagnitude and direction are found using the components of\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}$\n\n:\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=\\sqrt{{(1.20\\text{N})}^{2}+{(2.80\\text{N})}^{2}}=3.05\\text{N}\\text{and}Î¸={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{2.80}{1.20})=66.8\\text{Â°}.{F}_{\\text{net}}=\\sqrt{{(1.20\\text{N})}^{2}+{(2.80\\text{N})}^{2}}=3.05\\text{N}\\text{and}Î¸={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{2.80}{1.20})=66.8\\text{Â°}.$\n\nSignificance\n\nWe must remember that Newtonâs second law is a vector equation. In (a), we are multiplying a vector by a scalar to determine the net force in vector form. While the vector form gives a compact representation of the force vector, it does not tell us how âbigâ it is, or where it goes, in intuitive terms. In (b), we are determining the actual size (magnitude) of this force and the direction in which it travels.\n\nExample\n\n5.6\n\nMass of a Car\n\nFind the mass of a car if a net force of\n\n$â600.0j^\\text{N}â600.0j^\\text{N}$\n\nproduces an acceleration of\n\n$â0.2j^{\\text{m/s}}^{2}â0.2j^{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n.\n\nStrategy\n\nVector division is not defined, so\n\n$m={Fâ}_{\\text{net}}\\text{/}aâm={Fâ}_{\\text{net}}\\text{/}aâ$\n\ncannot be performed.

We can see that the solution of this example is just an extension of what we have already done.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n5.5\n\nA car has forces acting on it, as shown below. The mass of the car is 1000.0 kg. The road is slick, so friction can be ignored. (a) What is the net force on the car? (b) What is the acceleration of the car?\n\nNewtonâs Second Law and Momentum\n\nNewton actually stated his second law in terms of momentum: âThe instantaneous rate at which a bodyâs momentum changes is equal to the net force acting on the body.â (âInstantaneous rateâ implies that the derivative is involved.) This can be given by the vector equation\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=\\frac{dpâ}{dt}.{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=\\frac{dpâ}{dt}.$\n\n5.6\n\nThis means that Newtonâs second law addresses the central question of motion: What causes a change in motion of an object? Momentum was described by Newton as âquantity of motion,â a way of combining both the velocity of an object and its mass. We devote\n\nLinear Momentum and Collisions\n\nto the study of\n\nmomentum\n\n.\n\nFor now, it is sufficient to define\n\nmomentum\n\n$pâpâ$\n\nas the product of the mass of the object\n\nm\n\nand its velocity\n\n$vâvâ$\n\n:\n\n$pâ=mvâ.pâ=mvâ.$\n\n5.7\n\nSince velocity is a vector, so is momentum.\n\nIt is easy to visualize momentum. A train moving at 10 m/s has more momentum than one that moves at 2 m/s. In everyday life, we speak of one sports team as âhaving momentumâ when they score points against the opposing team.\n\nIf we substitute\n\nEquation 5.7\n\ninto\n\nEquation 5.6\n\n, we obtain\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=\\frac{dpâ}{dt}=\\frac{d(mvâ)}{dt}.{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=\\frac{dpâ}{dt}=\\frac{d(mvâ)}{dt}.$\n\nWhen\n\nm\n\nis constant, we have\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=m\\frac{d(vâ)}{dt}=maâ.{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=m\\frac{d(vâ)}{dt}=maâ.$\n\nThus, we see that the momentum form of Newtonâs second law reduces to the form given earlier in this section.\n\nInteractive\n\nExplore the\n\nforces at work\n\nwhen\n\npulling a cart\n\nor pushing a refrigerator, crate, or person.

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nExplain the difference between mass and weight\n\nExplain why objects falling through the air are never truly in free fall\n\nDescribe the concept of weightlessness\n\nMass and weight are often used interchangeably in everyday conversation. For example, our medical records often show our weight in kilograms but never in the correct units of newtons. In physics, however, there is an important distinction. Weight is the pull of Earth on an object. It depends on the distance from the center of Earth. Unlike weight, mass does not vary with location. The mass of an object is the same on Earth, in orbit, or on the surface of the Moon.\n\nUnits of Force\n\nThe equation\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=ma{F}_{\\text{net}}=ma$\n\nis used to define net force in terms of mass, length, and time. As explained earlier, the SI unit of force is the newton. Since\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=ma,{F}_{\\text{net}}=ma,$\n\n$1\\text{N}=1\\text{kg}Â·{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.1\\text{N}=1\\text{kg}Â·{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.$\n\nAlthough almost the entire world uses the newton for the unit of force, in the United States, the most familiar unit of force is the pound (lb), where 1 N = 0.225 lb. Thus, a 225-lb person weighs 1000 N.\n\nWeight and Gravitational Force\n\nWhen an object is dropped, it accelerates toward the center of Earth. Newtonâs second law says that a net force on an object is responsible for its acceleration. If air resistance is negligible, the net force on a falling object is the gravitational force, commonly called its\n\nweight\n\n$wâwâ$\n\n, or its force due to gravity acting on an object of mass\n\nm\n\n. Weight can be denoted as a vector because it has a direction;\n\ndown\n\nis, by definition, the direction of gravity, and hence, weight is a downward force. The magnitude of weight is denoted as\n\nw\n\n. Galileo was instrumental in showing that, in the absence of air resistance, all objects fall with the same acceleration\n\ng\n\n. Using Galileoâs result and Newtonâs second law, we can derive an equation for weight.\n\nConsider an object with mass\n\nm\n\nfalling toward Earth. It experiences only the downward force of gravity, which is the weight\n\n$wâwâ$\n\n. Newtonâs second law says that the magnitude of the net external force on an object is\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=maâ.{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=maâ.$\n\nWe know that the acceleration of an object due to gravity is\n\n$gâ,gâ,$\n\nor\n\n$aâ=gâaâ=gâ$\n\n. Substituting these into Newtonâs second law gives us the following equations.\n\nWeight\n\nThe gravitational force on a mass is its weight. We can write this in vector form, where\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nis weight and\n\nm\n\nis mass, as\n\n$wâ=mgâ.wâ=mgâ.$\n\n5.8\n\nIn scalar form, we can write\n\n$w=mg.w=mg.$\n\n5.9\n\nSince\n\n$g=9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2}g=9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\non Earth, the weight of a 1.00-kg object on Earth is 9.80 N:\n\n$w=mg=(1.00\\text{kg})({9.80\\text{m/s}}^{2})=9.80\\text{N}.w=mg=(1.00\\text{kg})({9.80\\text{m/s}}^{2})=9.80\\text{N}.$\n\nWhen the net external force on an object is its weight, we say that it is in\n\nfree fall\n\n, that is, the only force acting on the object is gravity. However, when objects on Earth fall downward through the air, they are never truly in free fall because there is always some upward resistance force from the air acting on the object.\n\nAcceleration due to gravity\n\ng\n\nvaries slightly over the surface of Earth, so the weight of an object depends on its location and is not an intrinsic property of the object. Weight varies dramatically if we leave Earthâs surface. On the Moon, for example, acceleration due to gravity is only\n\n${1.62\\text{m/s}}^{2}{1.62\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n. A 1.0-kg mass thus has a weight of 9.8 N on Earth and only about 1.6 N on the Moon.\n\nThe broadest definition of weight in this sense is that the weight of an object is the gravitational force on it from the nearest large body, such as Earth, the Moon, or the Sun. This is the most common and useful definition of weight in physics. It differs dramatically, however, from the definition of weight used by NASA and the popular media in relation to space travel and exploration. When they speak of âweightlessnessâ and âmicrogravity,â they are referring to the phenomenon we call âfree fallâ in physics. We use the preceding definition of weight, force\n\n$wâwâ$\n\ndue to gravity acting on an object of mass\n\nm\n\n, and we make careful distinctions between free fall and actual weightlessness.\n\nBe aware that weight and mass are different physical quantities, although they are closely related. Mass is an intrinsic property of an object: It is a quantity of matter. The quantity or amount of matter of an object is determined by the numbers of atoms and molecules of various types it contains. Because these numbers do not vary, in Newtonian physics, mass does not vary; therefore, its response to an applied force does not vary. In contrast, weight is the gravitational force acting on an object, so it does vary depending on gravity. For example, a person closer to the center of Earth, at a low elevation such as New Orleans, weighs slightly more than a person who is located in the higher elevation of Denver, even though they may have the same mass.\n\nIt is tempting to equate mass to weight, because most of our examples take place on Earth, where the weight of an object varies only a little with the location of the object. In addition, it is difficult to count and identify all of the atoms and molecules in an object, so mass is rarely determined in this manner. If we consider situations in which\n\n$gâgâ$\n\nis a constant on Earth, we see that weight\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nis directly proportional to mass\n\nm\n\n, since\n\n$wâ=mgâ,wâ=mgâ,$\n\nthat is, the more massive an object is, the more it weighs. Operationally, the masses of objects are determined by comparison with the standard kilogram, as we discussed in\n\nUnits and Measurement\n\n. But by comparing an object on Earth with one on the Moon, we can easily see a variation in weight but not in mass. For instance, on Earth, a 5.0-kg object weighs 49 N; on the Moon, where\n\ng\n\nis\n\n${1.67\\text{m/s}}^{2}{1.67\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n, the object weighs 8.4 N. However, the mass of the object is still 5.0 kg on the Moon.\n\nExample\n\n5.8\n\nClearing a Field\n\nA farmer is lifting some moderately heavy rocks from a field to plant crops. He lifts a stone that weighs 40.0 lb. (about 180 N). What force does he apply if the stone accelerates at a rate of\n\n$1.5{\\text{m/s}}^{2}?1.5{\\text{m/s}}^{2}?$\n\nStrategy\n\nWe were given the weight of the stone, which we use in finding the net force on the stone. However, we also need to know its mass to apply Newtonâs second law, so we must apply the equation for weight,\n\n$w=mgw=mg$\n\n, to determine the mass.\n\nSolution\n\nNo forces act in the horizontal direction, so we can concentrate on vertical forces, as shown in the following free-body diagram. We label the acceleration to the side; technically, it is not part of the free-body diagram, but it helps to remind us that the object accelerates upward (so the net force is upward).\n\n$w=mgm=\\frac{w}{g}=\\frac{180\\text{N}}{9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2}}=18\\text{kg}âF=maFâw=maFâ180\\text{N}=(18\\text{kg})(1.5{\\text{m/s}}^{2})Fâ180\\text{N}=27\\text{N}F=207\\text{N}=210\\text{N to two significant figures}w=mgm=\\frac{w}{g}=\\frac{180\\text{N}}{9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2}}=18\\text{kg}âF=maFâw=maFâ180\\text{N}=(18\\text{kg})(1.5{\\text{m/s}}^{2})Fâ180\\text{N}=27\\text{N}F=207\\text{N}=210\\text{N to two significant figures}$\n\nSignificance\n\nTo apply Newtonâs second law as the primary equation in solving a problem, we sometimes have to rely on other equations, such as the one for weight or one of the kinematic equations, to complete the solution.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n5.6\n\nFor\n\nExample 5.8\n\n, find the acceleration when the farmerâs applied force is 230.0 N."

    "chapter": 5,
    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nState Newtonâs third law of motion\n\nIdentify the action and reaction forces in different situations\n\nApply Newtonâs third law to define systems and solve problems of motion\n\nWe have thus far considered force as a push or a pull; however, if you think about it, you realize that no push or pull ever occurs by itself. When you push on a wall, the wall pushes back on you. This brings us to\n\nNewtonâs third law\n\n.\n\nNewtonâs Third Law of Motion\n\nWhenever one body exerts a force on a second body, the first body experiences a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that it exerts. Mathematically, if a body\n\nA\n\nexerts a force\n\n$FâFâ$\n\non body\n\nB\n\n, then\n\nB\n\nsimultaneously exerts a force\n\n$\\text{â}Fâ\\text{â}Fâ$\n\non\n\nA\n\n, or in vector equation form,\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{AB}}=\\text{â}{Fâ}_{\\text{BA}}.{Fâ}_{\\text{AB}}=\\text{â}{Fâ}_{\\text{BA}}.$\n\n5.10\n\nNewtonâs third law represents a certain symmetry in nature: Forces always occur in pairs, and one body cannot exert a force on another without experiencing a force itself. We sometimes refer to this law loosely as âaction-reaction,â where the force exerted is the action and the force experienced as a consequence is the reaction. Newtonâs third law has practical uses in analyzing the origin of forces and understanding which forces are external to a system.\n\nWe can readily see Newtonâs third law at work by taking a look at how people move about. Consider a swimmer pushing off the side of a pool (\n\nFigure 5.16\n\n). She pushes against the wall of the pool with her feet and accelerates in the direction opposite that of her push. The wall has exerted an equal and opposite force on the swimmer. You might think that two equal and opposite forces would cancel, but they do not\n\nbecause they act on different systems\n\n. In this case, there are two systems that we could investigate: the swimmer and the wall. If we select the swimmer to be the system of interest, as in the figure, then\n\n${F}_{\\text{wall on feet}}{F}_{\\text{wall on feet}}$\n\nis an external force on this system and affects its motion. The swimmer moves in the direction of this force. In contrast, the force\n\n${F}_{\\text{feet on wall}}{F}_{\\text{feet on wall}}$\n\nacts on the wall, not on our system of interest. Thus,\n\n${F}_{\\text{feet on wall}}{F}_{\\text{feet on wall}}$\n\ndoes not directly affect the motion of the system and does not cancel\n\n${F}_{\\text{wall on feet}}.{F}_{\\text{wall on feet}}.$\n\nThe swimmer pushes in the direction opposite that in which she wishes to move. The reaction to her push is thus in the desired direction. In a free-body diagram, such as the one shown in\n\nFigure 5.16\n\n, we never include both forces of an action-reaction pair; in this case, we only use\n\n${F}_{\\text{wall on feet}}{F}_{\\text{wall on feet}}$\n\n, not\n\n${F}_{\\text{feet on wall}}{F}_{\\text{feet on wall}}$\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n5.16\n\nWhen the swimmer exerts a force on the wall, she accelerates in the opposite direction; in other words, the net external force on her is in the direction opposite of\n\n${F}_{\\text{feet on wall}}.{F}_{\\text{feet on wall}}.$\n\nThis opposition occurs because, in accordance with Newtonâs third law, the wall exerts a force\n\n${F}_{\\text{wall on feet}}{F}_{\\text{wall on feet}}$\n\non the swimmer that is equal in magnitude but in the direction opposite to the one she exerts on it. The line around the swimmer indicates the system of interest. Thus, the free-body diagram shows only\n\n${F}_{\\text{wall on feet}},{F}_{\\text{wall on feet}},$\n\nw\n\n(the gravitational force), and\n\nBF\n\n, which is the buoyant force of the water supporting the swimmerâs weight. The vertical forces\n\nw\n\nand\n\nBF\n\ncancel because there is no vertical acceleration.\n\nOther examples of Newtonâs third law are easy to find:\n\nAs a professor paces in front of a whiteboard, he exerts a force backward on the floor. The floor exerts a reaction force forward on the professor that causes him to accelerate forward.\n\nA car accelerates forward because the ground pushes forward on the drive wheels, in reaction to the drive wheels pushing backward on the ground. You can see evidence of the wheels pushing backward when tires spin on a gravel road and throw the rocks backward.\n\nRockets move forward by expelling gas backward at high velocity. This means the rocket exerts a large backward force on the gas in the rocket combustion chamber; therefore, the gas exerts a large reaction force forward on the rocket. This reaction force, which pushes a body forward in response to a backward force, is called\n\nthrust\n\n. It is a common misconception that rockets propel themselves by pushing on the ground or on the air behind them. They actually work better in a vacuum, where they can more readily expel the exhaust gases.\n\nHelicopters create lift by pushing air down, thereby experiencing an upward reaction force.\n\nBirds and airplanes also fly by exerting force on the air in a direction opposite that of whatever force they need. For example, the wings of a bird force air downward and backward to get lift and move forward.\n\nAn octopus propels itself in the water by ejecting water through a funnel from its body, similar to a jet ski.\n\nWhen a person pulls down on a vertical rope, the rope pulls up on the person (\n\nFigure 5.17\n\n).\n\nFigure\n\n5.17\n\nWhen the mountain climber pulls down on the rope, the rope pulls up on the mountain climber. (credit left: modification of work by Cristian Bortes)\n\nThere are two important features of Newtonâs third law. First, the forces exerted (the action and reaction) are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. Second, these forces are acting on different bodies or systems:\n\nA\n\nâs force acts on\n\nB\n\nand\n\nB\n\nâs force acts on\n\nA\n\n. In other words, the two forces are distinct forces that do not act on the same body. Thus, they do not cancel each other.\n\nFor the situation shown in\n\nFigure 5.6\n\n, the third law indicates that because the chair is pushing upward on the boy with force\n\n$Câ,Câ,$\n\nhe is pushing downward on the chair with force\n\n$\\text{â}Câ.\\text{â}Câ.$\n\nSimilarly, he is pushing downward with forces\n\n$\\text{â}Fâ\\text{â}Fâ$\n\nand\n\n$\\text{â}Tâ\\text{â}Tâ$\n\non the floor and table, respectively. Finally, since Earth pulls downward on the boy with force\n\n$wâ,wâ,$\n\nhe pulls upward on Earth with force\n\n$\\text{â}wâ\\text{â}wâ$\n\n. If that student were to angrily pound the table in frustration, he would quickly learn the painful lesson (avoidable by studying Newtonâs laws) that the table hits back just as hard.\n\nA person who is walking or running applies Newtonâs third law instinctively. For example, the runner in\n\nFigure 5.18\n\npushes backward on the ground so that it pushes him forward.\n\nFigure\n\n5.18\n\nThe runner experiences Newtonâs third law. (a) A force is exerted by the runner on the ground. (b) The reaction force of the ground on the runner pushes him forward.

For the scale and package at rest (i.e., not accelerating), show that the scale indicates the weight of the package.\n\nFigure\n\n5.19\n\n(a) The forces on a package sitting on a scale, along with their reaction forces. The force\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nis the weight of the package (the force due to Earthâs gravity) and\n\n$SâSâ$\n\nis the force of the scale on the package. (b) Isolation of the package-scale system and the package-Earth system makes the action and reaction pairs clear.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe forces on the package are\n\n$Sâ,Sâ,$\n\nwhich is due to the scale, and\n\n$\\text{â}wâ,\\text{â}wâ,$\n\nwhich is due to Earthâs gravitational field. The reaction forces that the package exerts are\n\n$\\text{â}Sâ\\text{â}Sâ$\n\non the scale and\n\n$wâwâ$\n\non Earth. Because the package is not accelerating, application of the second law yields\n\n$Sââwâ=maâ=0â,Sââwâ=maâ=0â,$\n\nso\n\n$Sâ=wâ.Sâ=wâ.$\n\nThe scale reading indicates the magnitude of the force\n\n$SâSâ$\n\n, which is equal to the magnitude of the packageâs weight.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe scale actually does not measure the weight of the package; it measures the force\n\n$\\text{â}Sâ\\text{â}Sâ$\n\non its surface. If the system is accelerating,\n\n$SâSâ$\n\nand\n\n$\\text{â}wâ\\text{â}wâ$\n\nwould not be equal, as explained in\n\nApplications of Newtonâs Laws\n\n.\n\nExample\n\n5.10\n\nGetting Up to Speed: Choosing the Correct System\n\nA physics professor pushes a cart of demonstration equipment to a lecture hall (\n\nFigure 5.20\n\n). Her mass is 65.0 kg, the cartâs mass is 12.0 kg, and the equipmentâs mass is 7.0 kg. Calculate the acceleration produced when the professor exerts a backward force of 150 N on the floor. All forces opposing the motion, such as friction on the cartâs wheels and air resistance, total 24.0 N.\n\nFigure\n\n5.20\n\nA professor pushes the cart with her demonstration equipment. The lengths of the arrows are proportional to the magnitudes of the forces (except for\n\n$fâ\\text{,}fâ\\text{,}$\n\nbecause it is too small to be drawn to scale). System 1 is appropriate for this example, because it asks for the acceleration of the entire group of objects. Only\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{floor}}{Fâ}_{\\text{floor}}$\n\nand\n\n$fâfâ$\n\nare external forces acting on System 1 along the line of motion. All other forces either cancel or act on the outside world. System 2 is chosen for the next example so that\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{prof}}{Fâ}_{\\text{prof}}$\n\nis an external force and enters into Newtonâs second law. The free-body diagrams, which serve as the basis for Newtonâs second law, vary with the system chosen.\n\nStrategy\n\nSince they accelerate as a unit, we define the system to be the professor, cart, and equipment. This is System 1 in\n\nFigure 5.20\n\n. The professor pushes backward with a force\n\n${F}_{\\text{foot}}{F}_{\\text{foot}}$\n\nof 150 N. According to Newtonâs third law, the floor exerts a forward reaction force\n\n${F}_{\\text{floor}}{F}_{\\text{floor}}$\n\nof 150 N on System 1. Because all motion is horizontal, we can assume there is no net force in the vertical direction. Therefore, the problem is one-dimensional along the horizontal direction. As noted, friction\n\nf\n\nopposes the motion and is thus in the opposite direction of\n\n${F}_{\\text{floor}}.{F}_{\\text{floor}}.$\n\nWe do not include the forces\n\n${F}_{\\text{prof}}{F}_{\\text{prof}}$\n\nor\n\n${F}_{\\text{cart}}{F}_{\\text{cart}}$\n\nbecause these are internal forces, and we do not include\n\n${F}_{\\text{foot}}{F}_{\\text{foot}}$\n\nbecause it acts on the floor, not on the system. There are no other significant forces acting on System 1. If the net external force can be found from all this information, we can use Newtonâs second law to find the acceleration as requested. See the free-body diagram in the figure.\n\nSolution\n\nNewtonâs second law is given by\n\n$a=\\frac{{F}_{\\text{net}}}{m}.a=\\frac{{F}_{\\text{net}}}{m}.$\n\nThe net external force on System 1 is deduced from\n\nFigure 5.20\n\nand the preceding discussion to be\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}={F}_{\\text{floor}}âf=150\\text{N}â24.0\\text{N}=126\\text{N}\\text{.}{F}_{\\text{net}}={F}_{\\text{floor}}âf=150\\text{N}â24.0\\text{N}=126\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nThe mass of System 1 is\n\n$m=(65.0+12.0+7.0)\\text{kg}=84\\text{kg}\\text{.}m=(65.0+12.0+7.0)\\text{kg}=84\\text{kg}\\text{.}$\n\nThese values of\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}{F}_{\\text{net}}$\n\nand\n\nm\n\nproduce an acceleration of\n\n$a=\\frac{{F}_{\\text{net}}}{m}=\\frac{126\\text{N}}{84\\text{kg}}=1.5{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.a=\\frac{{F}_{\\text{net}}}{m}=\\frac{126\\text{N}}{84\\text{kg}}=1.5{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.$\n\nSignificance\n\nNone of the forces between components of System 1, such as between the professorâs hands and the cart, contribute to the net external force because they are internal to System 1. Another way to look at this is that forces between components of a system cancel because they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. For example, the force exerted by the professor on the cart results in an equal and opposite force back on the professor. In this case, both forces act on the same system and therefore cancel. Thus, internal forces (between components of a system) cancel. Choosing System 1 was crucial to solving this problem.\n\nExample\n\n5.11\n\nForce on the Cart: Choosing a New System\n\nCalculate the force the professor exerts on the cart in\n\nFigure 5.20\n\n, using data from the previous example if needed.\n\nStrategy\n\nIf we define the system of interest as the cart plus the equipment (System 2 in\n\nFigure 5.20\n\n), then the net external force on System 2 is the force the professor exerts on the cart minus friction. The force she exerts on the cart,\n\n${F}_{\\text{prof}}{F}_{\\text{prof}}$\n\n, is an external force acting on System 2.\n\n${F}_{\\text{prof}}{F}_{\\text{prof}}$\n\nwas internal to System 1, but it is external to System 2 and thus enters Newtonâs second law for this system.\n\nSolution\n\nNewtonâs second law can be used to find\n\n${F}_{\\text{prof}}.{F}_{\\text{prof}}.$\n\nWe start with\n\n$a=\\frac{{F}_{\\text{net}}}{m}.a=\\frac{{F}_{\\text{net}}}{m}.$\n\nThe magnitude of the net external force on System 2 is\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}={F}_{\\text{prof}}âf.{F}_{\\text{net}}={F}_{\\text{prof}}âf.$\n\nWe solve for\n\n${F}_{\\text{prof}}{F}_{\\text{prof}}$\n\n, the desired quantity:\n\n${F}_{\\text{prof}}={F}_{\\text{net}}+f.{F}_{\\text{prof}}={F}_{\\text{net}}+f.$\n\nThe value of\n\nf\n\nis given, so we must calculate net\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}.{F}_{\\text{net}}.$\n\nThat can be done because both the acceleration and the mass of System 2 are known. Using Newtonâs second law, we see that\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=ma,{F}_{\\text{net}}=ma,$\n\nwhere the mass of System 2 is 19.0 kg (\n\n$m=12.0\\text{kg}+7.0\\text{kg}m=12.0\\text{kg}+7.0\\text{kg}$\n\n) and its acceleration was found to be\n\n$a=1.5{\\text{m/s}}^{2}a=1.5{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\nin the previous example. Thus,\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=ma=(19.0\\text{kg})(1.5{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=29\\text{N}\\text{.}{F}_{\\text{net}}=ma=(19.0\\text{kg})(1.5{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=29\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nNow we can find the desired force:\n\n${F}_{\\text{prof}}={F}_{\\text{net}}+f=29\\text{N}+24.0\\text{N}=53\\text{N}\\text{.}{F}_{\\text{prof}}={F}_{\\text{net}}+f=29\\text{N}+24.0\\text{N}=53\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nThis force is significantly less than the 150-N force the professor exerted backward on the floor. Not all of that 150-N force is transmitted to the cart; some of it accelerates the professor. The choice of a system is an important analytical step both in solving problems and in thoroughly understanding the physics of the situation (which are not necessarily the same things).\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n5.7\n\nTwo blocks are at rest and in contact on a frictionless surface as shown below, with\n\n${m}_{1}=2.0\\text{kg},{m}_{1}=2.0\\text{kg},$\n\n${m}_{2}=6.0\\text{kg},{m}_{2}=6.0\\text{kg},$\n\nand applied force 24 N.

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nDefine normal and tension forces\n\nDistinguish between real and fictitious forces\n\nApply Newtonâs laws of motion to solve problems involving a variety of forces\n\nForces are given many names, such as push, pull, thrust, and weight. Traditionally, forces have been grouped into several categories and given names relating to their source, how they are transmitted, or their effects. Several of these categories are discussed in this section, together with some interesting applications. Further examples of forces are discussed later in this text.\n\nA Catalog of Forces: Normal, Tension, and Other Examples of Forces\n\nA catalog of forces will be useful for reference as we solve various problems involving force and motion. These forces include normal force, tension, friction, and spring force.\n\nNormal force\n\nWeight (also called the force of gravity) is a pervasive force that acts at all times and must be counteracted to keep an object from falling. You must support the weight of a heavy object by pushing up on it when you hold it stationary, as illustrated in\n\nFigure 5.21\n\n(a). But how do inanimate objects like a table support the weight of a mass placed on them, such as shown in\n\nFigure 5.21\n\n(b)? When the bag of dog food is placed on the table, the table sags slightly under the load. This would be noticeable if the load were placed on a card table, but even a sturdy oak table deforms when a force is applied to it. Unless an object is deformed beyond its limit, it will exert a restoring force much like a deformed spring (or a trampoline or diving board). The greater the deformation, the greater the restoring force. Thus, when the load is placed on the table, the table sags until the restoring force becomes as large as the weight of the load. At this point, the net external force on the load is zero. That is the situation when the load is stationary on the table. The table sags quickly and the sag is slight, so we do not notice it. But it is similar to the sagging of a trampoline when you climb onto it.\n\nFigure\n\n5.21\n\n(a) The person holding the bag of dog food must supply an upward force\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{hand}}{Fâ}_{\\text{hand}}$\n\nequal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the food\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nso that it doesnât drop to the ground. (b) The card table sags when the dog food is placed on it, much like a stiff trampoline. Elastic restoring forces in the table grow as it sags until they supply a force\n\n$NâNâ$\n\nequal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the load.\n\nWe must conclude that whatever supports a load, be it animate or not, must supply an upward force equal to the weight of the load, as we assumed in a few of the previous examples. If the force supporting the weight of an object, or a load, is perpendicular to the surface of contact between the load and its support, this force is defined as a\n\nnormal force\n\nand here is given by the symbol\n\n$Nâ.Nâ.$\n\n(This is not the newton unit for force, or N.) The word\n\nnormal\n\nmeans perpendicular to a surface. This means that the normal force experienced by an object resting on a horizontal surface can be expressed in vector form as follows:\n\n$Nâ=\\text{â}mgâ.Nâ=\\text{â}mgâ.$\n\nIn scalar form, this becomes\n\n$N=mg.N=mg.$\n\nThe normal force can be less than the objectâs weight if the object is on an incline.\n\nExample\n\n5.12\n\nWeight on an Incline\n\nConsider the skier on the slope in\n\nFigure 5.22\n\n. Her mass including equipment is 60.0 kg. (a) What is her acceleration if friction is negligible? (b) What is her acceleration if friction is 45.0 N?\n\nFigure\n\n5.22\n\nSince the acceleration is parallel to the slope and acting down the slope, it is most convenient to project all forces onto a coordinate system where one axis is parallel to the slope and the other is perpendicular to it (axes shown to the left of the skier).\n\n$NâNâ$\n\nis perpendicular to the slope and\n\n$fâfâ$\n\nis parallel to the slope, but\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nhas components along both axes, namely,\n\n${w}_{y}{w}_{y}$\n\nand\n\n${w}_{x}{w}_{x}$\n\n. Here,\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nhas a squiggly line to show that it has been replaced by these components. The force\n\n$NâNâ$\n\nis equal in magnitude to\n\n${w}_{y}{w}_{y}$\n\n, so there is no acceleration perpendicular to the slope, but\n\nf\n\nis less than\n\n${w}_{x}{w}_{x}$\n\n, so there is a downslope acceleration (along the axis parallel to the slope).\n\nStrategy\n\nThis is a two-dimensional problem, since not all forces on the skier (the system of interest) are parallel. The approach we have used in two-dimensional kinematics also works well here. Choose a convenient coordinate system and project the vectors onto its axes, creating two one-dimensional problems to solve. The most convenient coordinate system for motion on an incline is one that has one coordinate parallel to the slope and one perpendicular to the slope. (Motions along mutually perpendicular axes are independent.) We use\n\nx\n\nand\n\ny\n\nfor the parallel and perpendicular directions, respectively. This choice of axes simplifies this type of problem, because there is no motion perpendicular to the slope and the acceleration is downslope. Regarding the forces, friction is drawn in opposition to motion (friction always opposes forward motion) and is always parallel to the slope,\n\n${w}_{x}{w}_{x}$\n\nis drawn parallel to the slope and downslope (it causes the motion of the skier down the slope), and\n\n${w}_{y}{w}_{y}$\n\nis drawn as the component of weight perpendicular to the slope. Then, we can consider the separate problems of forces parallel to the slope and forces perpendicular to the slope.\n\nSolution\n\nThe magnitude of the component of weight parallel to the slope is\n\n${w}_{x}=w\\text{sin}25\\text{Â°}=mg\\text{sin}25\\text{Â°},{w}_{x}=w\\text{sin}25\\text{Â°}=mg\\text{sin}25\\text{Â°},$\n\nand the magnitude of the component of the weight perpendicular to the slope is\n\n${w}_{y}=w\\text{cos}25\\text{Â°}=mg\\text{cos}25\\text{Â°}.{w}_{y}=w\\text{cos}25\\text{Â°}=mg\\text{cos}25\\text{Â°}.$\n\na. Neglect friction. Since the acceleration is parallel to the slope, we need only consider forces parallel to the slope. (Forces perpendicular to the slope add to zero, since there is no acceleration in that direction.) The forces parallel to the slope are the component of the skierâs weight parallel to slope\n\n${w}_{x}{w}_{x}$\n\nand friction\n\nf\n\n. Using Newtonâs second law, with subscripts to denote quantities parallel to the slope,\n\n${a}_{x}=\\frac{{F}_{\\text{net}x}}{m}{a}_{x}=\\frac{{F}_{\\text{net}x}}{m}$\n\nwhere\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}x}={w}_{x}=âmg\\text{sin}25\\text{Â°},{F}_{\\text{net}x}={w}_{x}=âmg\\text{sin}25\\text{Â°},$\n\nassuming no friction for this part. Therefore,\n\n${a}_{x}=\\frac{{F}_{\\text{net}x}}{m}=\\frac{mg\\text{sin}25\\text{Â°}}{m}=g\\text{sin}25\\text{Â°}(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})(0.4226)=4.14{\\text{m/s}}^{2}{a}_{x}=\\frac{{F}_{\\text{net}x}}{m}=\\frac{mg\\text{sin}25\\text{Â°}}{m}=g\\text{sin}25\\text{Â°}(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})(0.4226)=4.14{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\nis the acceleration.\n\nb. Include friction. We have a given value for friction, and we know its direction is parallel to the slope and it opposes motion between surfaces in contact. So the net external force is\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}x}={w}_{x}âf.{F}_{\\text{net}x}={w}_{x}âf.$\n\nSubstituting this into Newtonâs second law,\n\n${a}_{x}={F}_{\\text{net}x}\\text{/}m,{a}_{x}={F}_{\\text{net}x}\\text{/}m,$\n\ngives\n\n${a}_{x}=\\frac{{F}_{\\text{net}x}}{m}=\\frac{{w}_{x}âf}{m}=\\frac{mg\\text{sin}25\\text{Â°}âf}{m}.{a}_{x}=\\frac{{F}_{\\text{net}x}}{m}=\\frac{{w}_{x}âf}{m}=\\frac{mg\\text{sin}25\\text{Â°}âf}{m}.$\n\nWe substitute known values to obtain\n\n${a}_{x}=\\frac{(60.0\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})(0.4226)â45.0\\text{N}}{60.0\\text{kg}}.{a}_{x}=\\frac{(60.0\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})(0.4226)â45.0\\text{N}}{60.0\\text{kg}}.$\n\nThis gives us\n\n${a}_{x}=3.39{\\text{m/s}}^{2},{a}_{x}=3.39{\\text{m/s}}^{2},$\n\nwhich is the acceleration parallel to the incline when there is 45.0 N of opposing friction.\n\nSignificance\n\nSince friction always opposes motion between surfaces, the acceleration is smaller when there is friction than when there is none. It is a general result that if friction on an incline is negligible, then the acceleration down the incline is\n\n$a=g\\text{sin}Î¸a=g\\text{sin}Î¸$\n\n, regardless of mass. As discussed previously, all objects fall with the same acceleration in the absence of air resistance. Similarly, all objects, regardless of mass, slide down a frictionless incline with the same acceleration (if the angle is the same).\n\nWhen an object rests on an incline that makes an angle\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\nwith the horizontal, the force of gravity acting on the object is divided into two components: a force acting perpendicular to the plane,\n\n${w}_{y}{w}_{y}$\n\n, and a force acting parallel to the plane,\n\n${w}_{x}{w}_{x}$\n\n(\n\nFigure 5.23\n\n). The normal force\n\n$NâNâ$\n\nis typically equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the perpendicular component of the weight\n\n${w}_{y}{w}_{y}$\n\n. The force acting parallel to the plane,\n\n${w}_{x}{w}_{x}$\n\n, causes the object to accelerate down the incline.\n\nFigure\n\n5.23\n\nAn object rests on an incline that makes an angle\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\nwith the horizontal.\n\nBe careful when resolving the weight of the object into components. If the incline is at an angle\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\nto the horizontal, then the magnitudes of the weight components are\n\n${w}_{x}=w\\text{sin}Î¸=mg\\text{sin}Î¸{w}_{x}=w\\text{sin}Î¸=mg\\text{sin}Î¸$\n\nand\n\n${w}_{y}=w\\text{cos}Î¸=mg\\text{cos}Î¸.{w}_{y}=w\\text{cos}Î¸=mg\\text{cos}Î¸.$\n\nWe use the second equation to write the normal force experienced by an object resting on an inclined plane:\n\n$N=mg\\text{cos}Î¸,N=mg\\text{cos}Î¸,$\n\nobject at rest or sliding on an inclined plane. Instead of memorizing these equations, it is helpful to be able to determine them from reason. To do this, we draw the right angle formed by the three weight vectors. The angle\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\nof the incline is the same as the angle formed between\n\nw\n\nand\n\n${w}_{y}{w}_{y}$\n\n. Knowing this property, we can use trigonometry to determine the magnitude of the weight components:\n\n$\\text{cos}Î¸=\\frac{{w}_{y}}{w},{w}_{y}=w\\text{cos}Î¸=mg\\text{cos}Î¸\\text{sin}Î¸=\\frac{{w}_{x}}{w},{w}_{x}=w\\text{sin}Î¸=mg\\text{sin}Î¸.\\text{cos}Î¸=\\frac{{w}_{y}}{w},{w}_{y}=w\\text{cos}Î¸=mg\\text{cos}Î¸\\text{sin}Î¸=\\frac{{w}_{x}}{w},{w}_{x}=w\\text{sin}Î¸=mg\\text{sin}Î¸.$\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n5.8\n\nA force of 1150 N acts parallel to a ramp to push a 250-kg gun safe into a moving van. The ramp is frictionless and inclined at\n\n$17\\text{Â°}.17\\text{Â°}.$\n\n(a) What is the acceleration of the safe up the ramp? (b) If we consider friction in this problem, with a friction force of 120 N, what is the acceleration of the safe?\n\nTension\n\nA\n\ntension\n\nis a force along the length of a medium; in particular, it is a pulling force that acts along a stretched flexible connector, such as a rope or cable. The word âtensionâ comes from a Latin word meaning âto stretch.â Not coincidentally, the flexible cords that carry muscle forces to other parts of the body are called\n\ntendons\n\n.\n\nAny flexible connector, such as a string, rope, chain, wire, or cable, can only exert a pull parallel to its length; thus, a force carried by a flexible connector is a tension with a direction parallel to the connector. Tension is a pull in a connector. Consider the phrase: âYou canât push a rope.â Instead, tension force pulls outward along the two ends of a rope.\n\nConsider a person holding a mass on a rope, as shown in\n\nFigure 5.24\n\n. If the 5.00-kg mass in the figure is stationary, then its acceleration is zero and the net force is zero. The only external forces acting on the mass are its weight and the tension supplied by the rope. Thus,\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=Tâw=0,{F}_{\\text{net}}=Tâw=0,$\n\nwhere\n\nT\n\nand\n\nw\n\nare the magnitudes of the tension and weight, respectively, and their signs indicate direction, with up being positive. As we proved using Newtonâs second law, the tension equals the weight of the supported mass:\n\n$T=w=mg,T=w=mg,$\n\nobject hanging at rest. Thus, for a 5.00-kg mass (neglecting the mass of the rope), we see that\n\n$T=mg=(5.00\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=49.0\\text{N}\\text{.}T=mg=(5.00\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=49.0\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nIf we cut the rope and insert a spring, the spring would extend a length corresponding to a force of 49.0 N, providing a direct observation and measure of the tension force in the rope.\n\nFigure\n\n5.24\n\nWhen a perfectly flexible connector (one requiring no force to bend it) such as this rope transmits a force\n\n$Tâ,Tâ,$\n\nthat force must be parallel to the length of the rope, as shown. By Newtonâs third law, the rope pulls with equal force but in opposite directions on the hand and the supported mass (neglecting the weight of the rope). The rope is the medium that carries the equal and opposite forces between the two objects. The tension anywhere in the rope between the hand and the mass is equal. Once you have determined the tension in one location, you have determined the tension at all locations along the rope.\n\nFlexible connectors are often used to transmit forces around corners, such as in a hospital traction system, a tendon, or a bicycle brake cable. If there is no friction, the tension transmission is undiminished; only its direction changes, and it is always parallel to the flexible connector, as shown in\n\nFigure 5.25\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n5.25\n\n(a) Tendons in the finger carry force\n\nT\n\nfrom the muscles to other parts of the finger, usually changing the forceâs direction but not its magnitude (the tendons are relatively friction free). (b) The brake cable on a bicycle carries the tension\n\nT\n\nfrom the brake lever on the handlebars to the brake mechanism. Again, the direction but not the magnitude of\n\nT\n\nis changed.\n\nExample\n\n5.13\n\nWhat Is the Tension in a Tightrope?\n\nCalculate the tension in the wire supporting the 70.0-kg tightrope walker shown in\n\nFigure 5.26\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n5.26\n\nThe weight of a tightrope walker causes a wire to sag by\n\n$5.0\\text{Â°}5.0\\text{Â°}$\n\n. The system of interest is the point in the wire at which the tightrope walker is standing.\n\nStrategy\n\nAs you can see in\n\nFigure 5.26\n\n, the wire is bent under the personâs weight. Thus, the tension on either side of the person has an upward component that can support his weight. As usual, forces are vectors represented pictorially by arrows that have the same direction as the forces and lengths proportional to their magnitudes. The system is the tightrope walker, and the only external forces acting on him are his weight\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nand the two tensions\n\n${Tâ}_{\\text{L}}{Tâ}_{\\text{L}}$\n\n(left tension) and\n\n${Tâ}_{\\text{R}}{Tâ}_{\\text{R}}$\n\n(right tension). It is reasonable to neglect the weight of the wire. The net external force is zero, because the system is static. We can use trigonometry to find the tensions. One conclusion is possible at the outsetâwe can see from\n\nFigure 5.26\n\n(b) that the magnitudes of the tensions\n\n${T}_{\\text{L}}{T}_{\\text{L}}$\n\nand\n\n${T}_{\\text{R}}{T}_{\\text{R}}$\n\nmust be equal. We know this because there is no horizontal acceleration in the rope and the only forces acting to the left and right are\n\n${T}_{\\text{L}}{T}_{\\text{L}}$\n\nand\n\n${T}_{\\text{R}}{T}_{\\text{R}}$\n\n. Thus, the magnitude of those horizontal components of the forces must be equal so that they cancel each other out.\n\nWhenever we have two-dimensional vector problems in which no two vectors are parallel, the easiest method of solution is to pick a convenient coordinate system and project the vectors onto its axes. In this case, the best coordinate system has one horizontal axis (\n\nx\n\n) and one vertical axis (\n\ny\n\n).\n\nSolution\n\nFirst, we need to resolve the tension vectors into their horizontal and vertical components. It helps to look at a new free-body diagram showing all horizontal and vertical components of each force acting on the system (\n\nFigure 5.27\n\n).\n\nFigure\n\n5.27\n\nWhen the vectors are projected onto vertical and horizontal axes, their components along these axes must add to zero, since the tightrope walker is stationary. The small angle results in\n\nT\n\nbeing much greater than\n\nw\n\n.\n\nConsider the horizontal components of the forces (denoted with a subscript\n\nx\n\n):\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}x}={T}_{\\text{R}x}â{T}_{\\text{L}x}.{F}_{\\text{net}x}={T}_{\\text{R}x}â{T}_{\\text{L}x}.$\n\nThe net external horizontal force\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}x}=0,{F}_{\\text{net}x}=0,$\n\nsince the person is stationary. Thus,\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}x}=0={T}_{\\text{R}x}â{T}_{\\text{L}x}{T}_{\\text{L}x}={T}_{\\text{R}x}.{F}_{\\text{net}x}=0={T}_{\\text{R}x}â{T}_{\\text{L}x}{T}_{\\text{L}x}={T}_{\\text{R}x}.$\n\nNow observe\n\nFigure 5.27\n\n. You can use trigonometry to determine the magnitude of\n\n${T}_{\\text{L}}{T}_{\\text{L}}$\n\nand\n\n${T}_{\\text{R}}{T}_{\\text{R}}$\n\n:\n\n$\\text{cos}5.0\\text{Â°}=\\frac{{T}_{\\text{L}x}}{{T}_{\\text{L}}},{T}_{\\text{L}x}={T}_{\\text{L}}\\text{cos}5.0\\text{Â°}\\text{cos}5.0\\text{Â°}=\\frac{{T}_{\\text{R}x}}{{T}_{\\text{R}}},{T}_{\\text{R}x}={T}_{\\text{R}}\\text{cos}5.0\\text{Â°}.\\text{cos}5.0\\text{Â°}=\\frac{{T}_{\\text{L}x}}{{T}_{\\text{L}}},{T}_{\\text{L}x}={T}_{\\text{L}}\\text{cos}5.0\\text{Â°}\\text{cos}5.0\\text{Â°}=\\frac{{T}_{\\text{R}x}}{{T}_{\\text{R}}},{T}_{\\text{R}x}={T}_{\\text{R}}\\text{cos}5.0\\text{Â°}.$\n\nEquating\n\nT\n\nL\n\nx\n\nand\n\nT\n\nR\n\nx\n\n:\n\n${T}_{\\text{L}}\\text{cos}5.0\\text{Â°}={T}_{\\text{R}}\\text{cos}5.0\\text{Â°}.{T}_{\\text{L}}\\text{cos}5.0\\text{Â°}={T}_{\\text{R}}\\text{cos}5.0\\text{Â°}.$\n\nThus,\n\n${T}_{\\text{L}}={T}_{\\text{R}}=T,{T}_{\\text{L}}={T}_{\\text{R}}=T,$\n\nas predicted. Now, considering the vertical components (denoted by a subscript\n\ny\n\n), we can solve for\n\nT\n\n. Again, since the person is stationary, Newtonâs second law implies that\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}y}=0{F}_{\\text{net}y}=0$\n\n. Thus, as illustrated in the free-body diagram,\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}y}={T}_{\\text{L}y}+{T}_{\\text{R}y}âw=0.{F}_{\\text{net}y}={T}_{\\text{L}y}+{T}_{\\text{R}y}âw=0.$\n\nWe can use trigonometry to determine the relationships among\n\n${T}_{\\text{Ly}},{T}_{\\text{Ry}},{T}_{\\text{Ly}},{T}_{\\text{Ry}},$\n\nand\n\nT\n\n. As we determined from the analysis in the horizontal direction,\n\n${T}_{\\text{L}}={T}_{\\text{R}}=T{T}_{\\text{L}}={T}_{\\text{R}}=T$\n\n:\n\n$\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}=\\frac{{T}_{\\text{L}y}}{{T}_{\\text{L}}},{T}_{\\text{L}y}={T}_{\\text{L}}\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}=T\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}=\\frac{{T}_{\\text{R}y}}{{T}_{\\text{R}}},{T}_{\\text{R}y}={T}_{\\text{R}}\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}=T\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}.\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}=\\frac{{T}_{\\text{L}y}}{{T}_{\\text{L}}},{T}_{\\text{L}y}={T}_{\\text{L}}\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}=T\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}=\\frac{{T}_{\\text{R}y}}{{T}_{\\text{R}}},{T}_{\\text{R}y}={T}_{\\text{R}}\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}=T\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}.$\n\nNow we can substitute the vales for\n\n${T}_{\\text{Ly}}{T}_{\\text{Ly}}$\n\nand\n\n${T}_{\\text{Ry}}{T}_{\\text{Ry}}$\n\n, into the net force equation in the vertical direction:\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}y}={T}_{\\text{L}y}+{T}_{\\text{R}y}âw=0{F}_{\\text{net}y}=T\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}+T\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}âw=02T\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}âw=02T\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}=w{F}_{\\text{net}y}={T}_{\\text{L}y}+{T}_{\\text{R}y}âw=0{F}_{\\text{net}y}=T\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}+T\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}âw=02T\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}âw=02T\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}=w$\n\nand\n\n$T=\\frac{w}{2\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}}=\\frac{mg}{2\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}},T=\\frac{w}{2\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}}=\\frac{mg}{2\\text{sin}5.0\\text{Â°}},$\n\nso\n\n$T=\\frac{(70.0\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})}{2(0.0872)},T=\\frac{(70.0\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})}{2(0.0872)},$\n\nand the tension is\n\n$T=3930\\text{N}\\text{.}T=3930\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nThe vertical tension in the wire acts as a force that supports the weight of the tightrope walker. The tension is almost six times the 686-N weight of the tightrope walker. Since the wire is nearly horizontal, the vertical component of its tension is only a fraction of the tension in the wire. The large horizontal components are in opposite directions and cancel, so most of the tension in the wire is not used to support the weight of the tightrope walker.\n\nIf we wish to create a large tension, all we have to do is exert a force perpendicular to a taut flexible connector, as illustrated in\n\nFigure 5.26\n\n. As we saw in\n\nExample 5.13\n\n, the weight of the tightrope walker acts as a force perpendicular to the rope. We saw that the tension in the rope is related to the weight of the tightrope walker in the following way:\n\n$T=\\frac{w}{2\\text{sin}Î¸}.T=\\frac{w}{2\\text{sin}Î¸}.$\n\nWe can extend this expression to describe the tension\n\nT\n\ncreated when a perpendicular force\n\n$({F}_{â¥})({F}_{â¥})$\n\nis exerted at the middle of a flexible connector:\n\n$T=\\frac{{F}_{â¥}}{2\\text{sin}Î¸}.T=\\frac{{F}_{â¥}}{2\\text{sin}Î¸}.$\n\nThe angle between the horizontal and the bent connector is represented by\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\n. In this case,\n\nT\n\nbecomes large as\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\napproaches zero. Even the relatively small weight of any flexible connector will cause it to sag, since an infinite tension would result if it were horizontal (i.e.,\n\n$Î¸=0Î¸=0$\n\nand sin\n\n$Î¸=0Î¸=0$\n\n). For example,\n\nFigure 5.28\n\nshows a situation where we wish to pull a car out of the mud when no tow truck is available. Each time the car moves forward, the chain is tightened to keep it as straight as possible. The tension in the chain is given by\n\n$T=\\frac{{F}_{â¥}}{2\\text{sin}Î¸},T=\\frac{{F}_{â¥}}{2\\text{sin}Î¸},$\n\nand since\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\nis small,\n\nT\n\nis large. This situation is analogous to the tightrope walker, except that the tensions shown here are those transmitted to the car and the tree rather than those acting at the point where\n\n${F}_{â¥}{F}_{â¥}$\n\nis applied.\n\nFigure\n\n5.28\n\nWe can create a large tension in the chainâand potentially a big messâby pushing on it perpendicular to its length, as shown.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n5.9\n\nOne end of a 3.0-m rope is tied to a tree; the other end is tied to a car stuck in the mud. The motorist pulls sideways on the midpoint of the rope, displacing it a distance of 0.25 m. If he exerts a force of 200.0 N under these conditions, determine the force exerted on the car.\n\nIn\n\nApplications of Newtonâs Laws\n\n, we extend the discussion on tension in a cable to include cases in which the angles shown are not equal.\n\nFriction\n\nFriction is a resistive force opposing motion or its tendency. Imagine an object at rest on a horizontal surface. The net force acting on the object must be zero, leading to equality of the weight and the normal force, which act in opposite directions. If the surface is tilted, the normal force balances the component of the weight perpendicular to the surface. If the object does not slide downward, the component of the weight parallel to the inclined plane is balanced by friction. Friction is discussed in greater detail in the next chapter.\n\nSpring force\n\nA spring is a special medium with a specific atomic structure that has the ability to restore its shape, if deformed. To restore its shape, a spring exerts a restoring force that is proportional to and in the opposite direction in which it is stretched or compressed. This is the statement of a law known as Hookeâs law, which has the mathematical form\n\n$Fâ=\\text{â}kxâ.Fâ=\\text{â}kxâ.$\n\n5.11\n\nThe constant of proportionality\n\nk\n\nis a measure of the springâs stiffness. The line of action of this force is parallel to the spring axis, and the sense of the force is in the opposite direction of the displacement vector (\n\nFigure 5.29\n\n). The displacement must be measured from the relaxed position;\n\n$x=0x=0$\n\nwhen the spring is relaxed.\n\nFigure\n\n5.29\n\nA spring exerts its force proportional to a displacement, whether it is compressed or stretched. (a) The spring is in a relaxed position and exerts no force on the block. (b) The spring is compressed by displacement\n\n$\\text{Î}{xâ}_{1}\\text{Î}{xâ}_{1}$\n\nof the object and exerts restoring force\n\n$\\text{â}k\\text{Î}{xâ}_{1}.\\text{â}k\\text{Î}{xâ}_{1}.$\n\n(c) The spring is stretched by displacement\n\n$\\text{Î}{xâ}_{2}\\text{Î}{xâ}_{2}$\n\nof the object and exerts restoring force\n\n$\\text{â}k\\text{Î}{xâ}_{2}.\\text{â}k\\text{Î}{xâ}_{2}.$\n\nReal Forces and Inertial Frames\n\nThere is another distinction among forces: Some forces are real, whereas others are not.\n\nReal forces\n\nhave some physical origin, such as a gravitational pull. In contrast,\n\nfictitious forces\n\narise simply because an observer is in an accelerating or noninertial frame of reference, such as one that rotates (like a merry-go-round) or undergoes linear acceleration (like a car slowing down). For example, if a satellite is heading due north above Earthâs Northern Hemisphere, then to an observer on Earth, it will appear to experience a force to the west that has no physical origin. Instead, Earth is rotating toward the east and moves east under the satellite. In Earthâs frame, this looks like a westward force on the satellite, or it can be interpreted as a violation of Newtonâs first law (the law of inertia). We can identify a fictitious force by asking the question, âWhat is the reaction force?â If we cannot name the reaction force, then the force we are considering is fictitious. In the example of the satellite, the reaction force would have to be an eastward force on Earth. Recall that an inertial frame of reference is one in which all forces are real and, equivalently, one in which Newtonâs laws have the simple forms given in this chapter.\n\nEarthâs rotation is slow enough that Earth is nearly an inertial frame. You ordinarily must perform precise experiments to observe fictitious forces and the slight departures from Newtonâs laws, such as the effect just described. On a large scale, such as for the rotation of weather systems and ocean currents, the effects can be easily observed (\n\nFigure 5.30\n\n).\n\nFigure\n\n5.30\n\nHurricane Fran is shown heading toward the southeastern coast of the United States in September 1996. Notice the characteristic âeyeâ shape of the hurricane. This is a result of the Coriolis effect, which is the deflection of objects (in this case, air) when considered in a rotating frame of reference, like the spin of Earth. This hurricane shows a counter-clockwise rotation because it is a low pressure storm. (credit \"runner\": modification of work by \"Greenwich Photography\"/Flickr)\n\nThe crucial factor in determining whether a frame of reference is inertial is whether it accelerates or rotates relative to a known inertial frame. Unless stated otherwise, all phenomena discussed in this text are in inertial frames.\n\nThe forces discussed in this section are real forces, but they are not the only real forces. Lift and thrust, for example, are more specialized real forces. In the long list of forces, are some more basic than others? Are some different manifestations of the same underlying force? The answer to both questions is yes, as you will see in the treatment of modern physics later in the text.\n\nInteractive\n\nExplore forces and motion in this\n\ninteractive simulation\n\nas you push household objects up and down a ramp. Lower and raise the ramp to see how the angle of inclination affects the parallel forces. Graphs show forces, energy, and work.\n\nInteractive\n\nStretch and compress springs in the simulation below to explore the relationships among force, spring constant, and displacement.

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nExplain the rules for drawing a free-body diagram\n\nConstruct free-body diagrams for different situations\n\nThe first step in describing and analyzing most phenomena in physics involves the careful drawing of a free-body diagram. Free-body diagrams have been used in examples throughout this chapter. Remember that a free-body diagram must only include the external forces acting on the body of interest. Once we have drawn an accurate free-body diagram, we can apply Newtonâs first law if the body is in equilibrium (balanced forces; that is,\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=0{F}_{\\text{net}}=0$\n\n) or Newtonâs second law if the body is accelerating (unbalanced force; that is,\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}â0{F}_{\\text{net}}â0$\n\n).\n\nIn\n\nForces\n\n, we gave a brief problem-solving strategy to help you understand free-body diagrams. Here, we add some details to the strategy that will help you in constructing these diagrams.\n\nProblem-Solving Strategy\n\nConstructing Free-Body Diagrams\n\nObserve the following rules when constructing a free-body diagram:\n\nDraw the object under consideration; it does not have to be artistic. At first, you may want to draw a circle around the object of interest to be sure you focus on labeling the forces acting on the object. If you are treating the object as a particle (no size or shape and no rotation), represent the object as a point. We often place this point at the origin of an\n\nxy\n\n-coordinate system.\n\nInclude all forces that act on the object, representing these forces as vectors. Consider the types of forces described in\n\nCommon Forces\n\nânormal force, friction, tension, and spring forceâas well as weight and applied force. Do not include the net force on the object. With the exception of gravity, all of the forces we have discussed require direct contact with the object. However, forces that the object exerts on its environment must not be included. We never include both forces of an action-reaction pair.\n\nConvert the free-body diagram into a more detailed diagram showing the\n\nx\n\n- and\n\ny\n\n-components of a given force (this is often helpful when solving a problem using Newtonâs first or second law). In this case, place a squiggly line through the original vector to show that it is no longer in playâit has been replaced by its\n\nx\n\n- and\n\ny\n\n-components.\n\nIf there are two or more objects, or bodies, in the problem, draw a separate free-body diagram for each object.\n\nNote:\n\nIf there is acceleration, we do not directly include it in the free-body diagram; however, it may help to indicate acceleration outside the free-body diagram. You can label it in a different color to indicate that it is separate from the free-body diagram.\n\nLetâs apply the problem-solving strategy in drawing a free-body diagram for a sled. In\n\nFigure 5.31\n\n(a), a sled is pulled by force\n\nP\n\nat an angle of\n\n$30\\text{Â°}30\\text{Â°}$\n\n. In part (b), we show a free-body diagram for this situation, as described by steps 1 and 2 of the problem-solving strategy. In part (c), we show all forces in terms of their\n\nx\n\n- and\n\ny\n\n-components, in keeping with step 3.\n\nFigure\n\n5.31\n\n(a) A moving sled is shown as (b) a free-body diagram and (c) a free-body diagram with force components.\n\nExample\n\n5.14\n\nTwo Blocks on an Inclined Plane\n\nConstruct the free-body diagram for object A and object B in\n\nFigure 5.32\n\n.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe follow the four steps listed in the problem-solving strategy.\n\nSolution\n\nWe start by creating a diagram for the first object of interest. In\n\nFigure 5.32\n\n(a), object A is isolated (circled) and represented by a dot.\n\nFigure\n\n5.32\n\n(a) The free-body diagram for isolated object A. (b) The free-body diagram for isolated object B. Comparing the two drawings, we see that friction acts in the opposite direction in the two figures. Because object A experiences a force that tends to pull it to the right, friction must act to the left. Because object B experiences a component of its weight that pulls it to the left, down the incline, the friction force must oppose it and act up the ramp. Friction always acts opposite the intended direction of motion.\n\nWe now include any force that acts on the body. Here, no applied force is present. The weight of the object acts as a force pointing vertically downward, and the presence of the cord indicates a force of tension pointing away from the object. Object A has one interface and hence experiences a normal force, directed away from the interface. The source of this force is object B, and this normal force is labeled accordingly. Since object B has a tendency to slide down, object A has a tendency to slide up with respect to the interface, so the friction\n\n${f}_{\\text{BA}}{f}_{\\text{BA}}$\n\nis directed downward parallel to the inclined plane.\n\nAs noted in step 4 of the problem-solving strategy, we then construct the free-body diagram in\n\nFigure 5.32\n\n(b) using the same approach. Object B experiences two normal forces and two friction forces due to the presence of two contact surfaces. The interface with the inclined plane exerts external forces of\n\n${N}_{\\text{B}}{N}_{\\text{B}}$\n\nand\n\n${f}_{\\text{B}}{f}_{\\text{B}}$\n\n, and the interface with object B exerts the normal force\n\n${N}_{\\text{AB}}{N}_{\\text{AB}}$\n\nand friction\n\n${f}_{\\text{AB}}{f}_{\\text{AB}}$\n\n;\n\n${N}_{\\text{AB}}{N}_{\\text{AB}}$\n\nis directed away from object B, and\n\n${f}_{\\text{AB}}{f}_{\\text{AB}}$\n\nis opposing the tendency of the relative motion of object B with respect to object A.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe object under consideration in each part of this problem was circled in gray. When you are first learning how to draw free-body diagrams, you will find it helpful to circle the object before deciding what forces are acting on that particular object. This focuses your attention, preventing you from considering forces that are not acting on the body.\n\nExample\n\n5.15\n\nTwo Blocks in Contact\n\nA force is applied to two blocks in contact, as shown. Draw the reaction forces between the two blocks.\n\nStrategy\n\nDraw a free-body diagram for each block. Be sure to consider Newtonâs third law at the interface where the two blocks touch.\n\nSolution\n\nSignificance\n\n${Aâ}_{21}{Aâ}_{21}$\n\nis the action force of block 2 on block 1.\n\n${Aâ}_{12}{Aâ}_{12}$\n\nis the reaction force of block 1 on block 2. We use these free-body diagrams in\n\nApplications of Newtonâs Laws\n\n.\n\nExample\n\n5.16\n\nBlock on the Table (Coupled Blocks)\n\nA block rests on the table, as shown. A light rope is attached to it and runs over a pulley. The other end of the rope is attached to a second block. The two blocks are said to be coupled. Block\n\n${m}_{2}{m}_{2}$\n\nexerts a force due to its weight, which causes the system (two blocks and a string) to accelerate.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe assume that the string has no mass so that we do not have to consider it as a separate object. Draw a free-body diagram for each block.\n\nSolution\n\nSignificance\n\nEach block accelerates (notice the labels shown for\n\n${aâ}_{1}{aâ}_{1}$\n\nand\n\n${aâ}_{2}{aâ}_{2}$\n\n); however, assuming the string remains taut, the magnitudes of acceleration are equal. Thus, we have\n\n$|{aâ}_{1}|=|{aâ}_{2}||{aâ}_{1}|=|{aâ}_{2}|$\n\n. If we were to continue solving the problem, we could simply call the acceleration\n\n$aâaâ$\n\n. Also, we use two free-body diagrams because we are usually finding tension\n\nT\n\n, which may require us to use a system of two equations in this type of problem. The tension is the same on both\n\n${m}_{1}\\text{and}{m}_{2}{m}_{1}\\text{and}{m}_{2}$\n\n.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n5.10\n\n(a) Draw the free-body diagram for the situation shown. (b) Redraw it showing components; use\n\nx\n\n-axes parallel to the two ramps.\n\nInteractive\n\nEngage the simulation below to predict, qualitatively, how an external force will affect the speed and direction of an objectâs motion. Explain the effects with the help of a free-body diagram. Use free-body diagrams to draw position, velocity, acceleration, and force graphs, and vice versa.

You also expect to speed up or slow your car in response to traffic changes. In both cases, you deal with forces. The forces on the bridge are in equilibrium, so it stays in place. In contrast, the force produced by your car engine causes a change in motion. Isaac Newton discovered the laws of motion that describe these situations.\n\nForces affect every moment of your life. Your body is held to Earth by force and held together by the forces of charged particles. When you open a door, walk down a street, lift your fork, or touch a babyâs face, you are applying forces. Zooming in deeper, your bodyâs atoms are held together by electrical forces, and the core of the atom, called the nucleus, is held together by the strongest force we knowâstrong nuclear force."

    "chapter": 5,
    "content": "Summary\n\n5.1\n\nForces\n\nDynamics is the study of how forces affect the motion of objects, whereas kinematics simply describes the way objects move.\n\nForce is a push or pull that can be defined in terms of various standards, and it is a vector that has both magnitude and direction.\n\nExternal forces are any outside forces that act on a body. A free-body diagram is a drawing of all external forces acting on a body.\n\nThe SI unit of force is the newton (N).\n\n5.2\n\nNewton's First Law\n\nAccording to Newtonâs first law, there must be a cause for any change in velocity (a change in either magnitude or direction) to occur. This law is also known as the law of inertia.\n\nFriction is an external force that causes an object to slow down.\n\nInertia is the tendency of an object to remain at rest or remain in motion. Inertia is related to an objectâs mass.\n\nIf an objectâs velocity relative to a given frame is constant, then the frame is inertial. This means that for an inertial reference frame, Newtonâs first law is valid.\n\nEquilibrium is achieved when the forces on a system are balanced.\n\nA net force of zero means that an object is either at rest or moving with constant velocity; that is, it is not accelerating.\n\n5.3\n\nNewton's Second Law\n\nAn external force acts on a system from outside the system, as opposed to internal forces, which act between components within the system.\n\nNewtonâs second law of motion says that the net external force on an object with a certain mass is directly proportional to and in the same direction as the acceleration of the object.\n\nNewtonâs second law can also describe net force as the instantaneous rate of change of momentum. Thus, a net external force causes nonzero acceleration.\n\n5.4\n\nMass and Weight\n\nMass is the quantity of matter in a substance.\n\nThe weight of an object is the net force on a falling object, or its gravitational force. The object experiences acceleration due to gravity.\n\nSome upward resistance force from the air acts on all falling objects on Earth, so they can never truly be in free fall.\n\nCareful distinctions must be made between free fall and weightlessness using the definition of weight as force due to gravity acting on an object of a certain mass.\n\n5.5\n\nNewtonâs Third Law\n\nNewtonâs third law of motion represents a basic symmetry in nature, with an experienced force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to an exerted force.\n\nTwo equal and opposite forces do not cancel because they act on different systems.\n\nAction-reaction pairs include a swimmer pushing off a wall, helicopters creating lift by pushing air down, and an octopus propelling itself forward by ejecting water from its body. Rockets, airplanes, and cars are pushed forward by a thrust reaction force.\n\nChoosing a system is an important analytical step in understanding the physics of a problem and solving it.\n\n5.6\n\nCommon Forces\n\nWhen an object rests on a surface, the surface applies a force to the object that supports the weight of the object. This supporting force acts perpendicular to and away from the surface. It is called a normal force.\n\nWhen an object rests on a nonaccelerating horizontal surface, the magnitude of the normal force is equal to the weight of the object.\n\nWhen an object rests on an inclined plane that makes an angle\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\nwith the horizontal surface, the weight of the object can be resolved into components that act perpendicular and parallel to the surface of the plane.\n\nThe pulling force that acts along a stretched flexible connector, such as a rope or cable, is called tension. When a rope supports the weight of an object at rest, the tension in the rope is equal to the weight of the object. If the object is accelerating, tension is greater than weight, and if it is accelerating opposite to the motion, tension is less than weight.\n\nThe force of friction is a force experienced by a moving object (or an object that has a tendency to move) parallel to the interface opposing the motion (or its tendency).\n\nThe force developed in a spring obeys Hookeâs law, according to which its magnitude is proportional to the displacement and has a sense in the opposite direction of the displacement.\n\nReal forces have a physical origin, whereas fictitious forces occur because the observer is in an accelerating or noninertial frame of reference.\n\n5.7\n\nDrawing Free-Body Diagrams\n\nTo draw a free-body diagram, we draw the object of interest, draw all forces acting on that object, and resolve all force vectors into\n\nx\n\n- and\n\ny\n\n-components. We must draw a separate free-body diagram for each object in the problem.\n\nA free-body diagram is a useful means of describing and analyzing all the forces that act on a body to determine equilibrium according to Newtonâs first law or acceleration according to Newtonâs second law."

Once you identify the physical principles involved in the problem and determine that they include Newtonâs laws of motion, you can apply these steps to find a solution. These techniques also reinforce concepts that are useful in many other areas of physics. Many problem-solving strategies are stated outright in the worked examples, so the following techniques should reinforce skills you have already begun to develop.\n\nProblem-Solving Strategy\n\nApplying Newtonâs Laws of Motion\n\nIdentify the physical principles involved by listing the givens and the quantities to be calculated.\n\nSketch the situation, using arrows to represent all forces.\n\nDetermine the system of interest. The result is a\n\nfree-body diagram\n\nthat is essential to solving the problem.\n\nApply Newtonâs second law to solve the problem. If necessary, apply appropriate kinematic equations from the chapter on motion along a straight line.\n\nCheck the solution to see whether it is reasonable.\n\nLetâs apply this problem-solving strategy to the challenge of lifting a grand piano into a second-story apartment. Once we have determined that Newtonâs laws of motion are involved (if the problem involves forces), it is particularly important to draw a careful sketch of the situation. Such a sketch is shown in\n\nFigure 6.2\n\n(a). Then, as in\n\nFigure 6.2\n\n(b), we can represent all forces with arrows. Whenever sufficient information exists, it is best to label these arrows carefully and make the length and direction of each correspond to the represented force.\n\nFigure\n\n6.2\n\n(a) A grand piano is being lifted to a second-story apartment. (b) Arrows are used to represent all forces:\n\n$TâTâ$\n\nis the tension in the rope above the piano,\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{T}}{Fâ}_{\\text{T}}$\n\nis the force that the piano exerts on the rope, and\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nis the weight of the piano. All other forces, such as the nudge of a breeze, are assumed to be negligible. (c) Suppose we are given the pianoâs mass and asked to find the tension in the rope. We then define the system of interest as shown and draw a free-body diagram. Now\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{T}}{Fâ}_{\\text{T}}$\n\nis no longer shown, because it is not a force acting on the system of interest; rather,\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{T}}{Fâ}_{\\text{T}}$\n\nacts on the outside world. (d) Showing only the arrows, the head-to-tail method of addition is used. It is apparent that if the piano is stationary,\n\n$Tâ=\\text{â}wâTâ=\\text{â}wâ$\n\n.\n\nAs with most problems, we next need to identify what needs to be determined and what is known or can be inferred from the problem as stated, that is, make a list of knowns and unknowns. It is particularly crucial to identify the system of interest, since Newtonâs second law involves only external forces. We can then determine which forces are external and which are internal, a necessary step to employ Newtonâs second law. (See\n\nFigure 6.2\n\n(c).) Newtonâs third law may be used to identify whether forces are exerted between components of a system (internal) or between the system and something outside (external). As illustrated in\n\nNewtonâs Laws of Motion\n\n, the system of interest depends on the question we need to answer. Only forces are shown in free-body diagrams, not acceleration or velocity. We have drawn several free-body diagrams in previous worked examples.\n\nFigure 6.2\n\n(c) shows a free-body diagram for the system of interest. Note that no internal forces are shown in a free-body diagram.\n\nOnce a free-body diagram is drawn, we apply Newtonâs second law. This is done in\n\nFigure 6.2\n\n(d) for a particular situation. In general, once external forces are clearly identified in free-body diagrams, it should be a straightforward task to put them into equation form and solve for the unknown, as done in all previous examples. If the problem is one-dimensionalâthat is, if all forces are parallelâthen the forces can be handled algebraically. If the problem is two-dimensional, then it must be broken down into a pair of one-dimensional problems. We do this by projecting the force vectors onto a set of axes chosen for convenience. As seen in previous examples, the choice of axes can simplify the problem. For example, when an incline is involved, a set of axes with one axis parallel to the incline and one perpendicular to it is most convenient. It is almost always convenient to make one axis parallel to the direction of motion, if this is known. Generally, just write Newtonâs second law in components along the different directions. Then, you have the following equations:\n\n$â{F}_{x}=m{a}_{x},â{F}_{y}=m{a}_{y}.â{F}_{x}=m{a}_{x},â{F}_{y}=m{a}_{y}.$\n\n(If, for example, the system is accelerating horizontally, then you can then set\n\n${a}_{y}=0.{a}_{y}=0.$\n\n) We need this information to determine unknown forces acting on a system.\n\nAs always, we must check the solution. In some cases, it is easy to tell whether the solution is reasonable. For example, it is reasonable to find that friction causes an object to slide down an incline more slowly than when no friction exists. In practice, intuition develops gradually through problem solving; with experience, it becomes progressively easier to judge whether an answer is reasonable. Another way to check a solution is to check the units. If we are solving for force and end up with units of millimeters per second, then we have made a mistake.\n\nThere are many interesting applications of Newtonâs laws of motion, a few more of which are presented in this section. These serve also to illustrate some further subtleties of physics and to help build problem-solving skills. We look first at problems involving particle equilibrium, which make use of Newtonâs first law, and then consider particle acceleration, which involves Newtonâs second law.\n\nParticle Equilibrium\n\nRecall that a particle in equilibrium is one for which the external forces are balanced. Static equilibrium involves objects at rest, and dynamic equilibrium involves objects in motion without acceleration, but it is important to remember that these conditions are relative. For example, an object may be at rest when viewed from our frame of reference, but the same object would appear to be in motion when viewed by someone moving at a constant velocity. We now make use of the knowledge attained in\n\nNewtonâs Laws of Motion\n\n, regarding the different types of forces and the use of free-body diagrams, to solve additional problems in\n\nparticle equilibrium\n\n.\n\nExample\n\n6.1\n\nDifferent Tensions at Different Angles\n\nConsider the traffic light (mass of 15.0 kg) suspended from two wires as shown in\n\nFigure 6.3\n\n. Find the tension in each wire, neglecting the masses of the wires.\n\nFigure\n\n6.3\n\nA traffic light is suspended from two wires. (b) Some of the forces involved. (c) Only forces acting on the system are shown here. The free-body diagram for the traffic light is also shown. (d) The forces projected onto vertical (\n\ny\n\n) and horizontal (\n\nx\n\n) axes. The horizontal components of the tensions must cancel, and the sum of the vertical components of the tensions must equal the weight of the traffic light. (e) The free-body diagram shows the vertical and horizontal forces acting on the traffic light.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe system of interest is the traffic light, and its free-body diagram is shown in\n\nFigure 6.3\n\n(c). The three forces involved are not parallel, and so they must be projected onto a coordinate system. The most convenient coordinate system has one axis vertical and one horizontal, and the vector projections on it are shown in\n\nFigure 6.3\n\n(d). There are two unknowns in this problem (\n\n${T}_{1}{T}_{1}$\n\nand\n\n${T}_{2}{T}_{2}$\n\n), so two equations are needed to find them. These two equations come from applying Newtonâs second law along the vertical and horizontal axes, noting that the net external force is zero along each axis because acceleration is zero.\n\nSolution\n\nFirst consider the horizontal or\n\nx\n\n-axis:\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}x}={T}_{2x}+{T}_{1x}=0.{F}_{\\text{net}x}={T}_{2x}+{T}_{1x}=0.$\n\nThus, as you might expect,\n\n$|{T}_{1x}|=|{T}_{2x}|.|{T}_{1x}|=|{T}_{2x}|.$\n\nThis gives us the following relationship:\n\n${T}_{1}\\text{cos}30\\text{Â°}={T}_{2}\\text{cos}45\\text{Â°}.{T}_{1}\\text{cos}30\\text{Â°}={T}_{2}\\text{cos}45\\text{Â°}.$\n\nThus,\n\n${T}_{2}=1.225{T}_{1}.{T}_{2}=1.225{T}_{1}.$\n\nNote that\n\n${T}_{1}{T}_{1}$\n\nand\n\n${T}_{2}{T}_{2}$\n\nare not equal in this case because the angles on either side are not equal. It is reasonable that\n\n${T}_{2}{T}_{2}$\n\nends up being greater than\n\n${T}_{1}{T}_{1}$\n\nbecause it is exerted more vertically than\n\n${T}_{1}.{T}_{1}.$\n\nNow consider the force components along the vertical or\n\ny\n\n-axis:\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}y}={T}_{1y}+{T}_{2y}âw=0.{F}_{\\text{net}y}={T}_{1y}+{T}_{2y}âw=0.$\n\nThis implies\n\n${T}_{1y}+{T}_{2y}=w.{T}_{1y}+{T}_{2y}=w.$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the vertical components gives\n\n${T}_{1}\\text{sin}30\\text{Â°}+{T}_{2}\\text{sin}45\\text{Â°}=w.{T}_{1}\\text{sin}30\\text{Â°}+{T}_{2}\\text{sin}45\\text{Â°}=w.$\n\nThere are two unknowns in this equation, but substituting the expression for\n\n${T}_{2}{T}_{2}$\n\nin terms of\n\n${T}_{1}{T}_{1}$\n\nreduces this to one equation with one unknown:\n\n${T}_{1}(0.500)+(1.225{T}_{1})(0.707)=w=mg,{T}_{1}(0.500)+(1.225{T}_{1})(0.707)=w=mg,$\n\nwhich yields\n\n$1.366{T}_{1}=(15.0\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2}).1.366{T}_{1}=(15.0\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2}).$\n\nSolving this last equation gives the magnitude of\n\n${T}_{1}{T}_{1}$\n\nto be\n\n${T}_{1}=108\\text{N}.{T}_{1}=108\\text{N}.$\n\nFinally, we find the magnitude of\n\n${T}_{2}{T}_{2}$\n\nby using the relationship between them,\n\n${T}_{2}=1.225{T}_{1}{T}_{2}=1.225{T}_{1}$\n\n, found above. Thus we obtain\n\n${T}_{2}=132\\text{N}.{T}_{2}=132\\text{N}.$\n\nSignificance\n\nBoth tensions would be larger if both wires were more horizontal, and they will be equal if and only if the angles on either side are the same (as they were in the earlier example of a tightrope walker in\n\nNewtonâs Laws of Motion\n\n.\n\nParticle Acceleration\n\nWe have given a variety of examples of particles in equilibrium. We now turn our attention to\n\nparticle acceleration\n\nproblems, which are the result of a nonzero net force. Refer again to the steps given at the beginning of this section, and notice how they are applied to the following examples.\n\nExample\n\n6.2\n\nDrag Force on a Barge\n\nTwo tugboats push on a barge at different angles (\n\nFigure 6.4\n\n). The first tugboat exerts a force of\n\n$2.7Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N}2.7Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N}$\n\nin the\n\nx\n\n-direction, and the second tugboat exerts a force of\n\n$3.6Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N}3.6Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N}$\n\nin the\n\ny\n\n-direction. The mass of the barge is\n\n$5.0Ã{10}^{6}\\text{kg}5.0Ã{10}^{6}\\text{kg}$\n\nand its acceleration is observed to be\n\n$7.5Ã{10}^{â2}{\\text{m/s}}^{2}7.5Ã{10}^{â2}{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\nin the direction shown. What is the drag force of the water on the barge resisting the motion? (\n\nNote:\n\nDrag force is a frictional force exerted by fluids, such as air or water. The\n\ndrag force\n\nopposes the motion of the object. Since the barge is flat bottomed, we can assume that the drag force is in the direction opposite of motion of the barge.)\n\nFigure\n\n6.4\n\n(a) A view from above of two tugboats pushing on a barge. (b) The free-body diagram for the ship contains only forces acting in the plane of the water. It omits the two vertical forcesâthe weight of the barge and the buoyant force of the water supporting it cancel and are not shown. Note that\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{app}}{Fâ}_{\\text{app}}$\n\nis the total applied force of the tugboats.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe directions and magnitudes of acceleration and the applied forces are given in\n\nFigure 6.4\n\n(a). We define the total force of the tugboats on the barge as\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{app}}{Fâ}_{\\text{app}}$\n\nso that\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{app}}={Fâ}_{1}+{Fâ}_{2}.{Fâ}_{\\text{app}}={Fâ}_{1}+{Fâ}_{2}.$\n\nThe drag of the water\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{D}}{Fâ}_{\\text{D}}$\n\nis in the direction opposite to the direction of motion of the boat; this force thus works against\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{app}},{Fâ}_{\\text{app}},$\n\nas shown in the free-body diagram in\n\nFigure 6.4\n\n(b). The system of interest here is the barge, since the forces on it are given as well as its acceleration. Because the applied forces are perpendicular, the\n\nx\n\n- and\n\ny\n\n-axes are in the same direction as\n\n${Fâ}_{1}{Fâ}_{1}$\n\nand\n\n${Fâ}_{2}.{Fâ}_{2}.$\n\nThe problem quickly becomes a one-dimensional problem along the direction of\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{app}}{Fâ}_{\\text{app}}$\n\n, since friction is in the direction opposite to\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{app}}.{Fâ}_{\\text{app}}.$\n\nOur strategy is to find the magnitude and direction of the net applied force\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{app}}{Fâ}_{\\text{app}}$\n\nand then apply Newtonâs second law to solve for the drag force\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{D}}.{Fâ}_{\\text{D}}.$\n\nSolution\n\nSince\n\n${F}_{x}{F}_{x}$\n\nand\n\n${F}_{y}{F}_{y}$\n\nare perpendicular, we can find the magnitude and direction of\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{app}}{Fâ}_{\\text{app}}$\n\ndirectly. First, the resultant magnitude is given by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n${F}_{\\text{app}}=\\sqrt{{F}_{1}^{2}+{F}_{2}^{2}}=\\sqrt{{(2.7Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N})}^{2}+{(3.6Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N})}^{2}}=4.5Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N}\\text{.}{F}_{\\text{app}}=\\sqrt{{F}_{1}^{2}+{F}_{2}^{2}}=\\sqrt{{(2.7Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N})}^{2}+{(3.6Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N})}^{2}}=4.5Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nThe angle is given by\n\n$Î¸={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{{F}_{2}}{{F}_{1}})={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{3.6Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N}}{2.7Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N}})=53.1\\text{Â°}.Î¸={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{{F}_{2}}{{F}_{1}})={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{3.6Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N}}{2.7Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N}})=53.1\\text{Â°}.$\n\nFrom Newtonâs first law, we know this is the same direction as the acceleration. We also know that\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{D}}{Fâ}_{\\text{D}}$\n\nis in the opposite direction of\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{app}},{Fâ}_{\\text{app}},$\n\nsince it acts to slow down the acceleration. Therefore, the net external force is in the same direction as\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{app}},{Fâ}_{\\text{app}},$\n\nbut its magnitude is slightly less than\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{app}}.{Fâ}_{\\text{app}}.$\n\nThe problem is now one-dimensional. From the free-body diagram, we can see that\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}={F}_{\\text{app}}â{F}_{\\text{D}}.{F}_{\\text{net}}={F}_{\\text{app}}â{F}_{\\text{D}}.$\n\nHowever, Newtonâs second law states that\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=ma.{F}_{\\text{net}}=ma.$\n\nThus,\n\n${F}_{\\text{app}}â{F}_{\\text{D}}=ma.{F}_{\\text{app}}â{F}_{\\text{D}}=ma.$\n\nThis can be solved for the magnitude of the drag force of the water\n\n${F}_{\\text{D}}{F}_{\\text{D}}$\n\nin terms of known quantities:\n\n${F}_{\\text{D}}={F}_{\\text{app}}âma.{F}_{\\text{D}}={F}_{\\text{app}}âma.$\n\nSubstituting known values gives\n\n${F}_{\\text{D}}=(4.5Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N})â(5.0Ã{10}^{6}\\text{kg})(7.5Ã{10}^{â2}{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=7.5Ã{10}^{4}\\text{N}\\text{.}{F}_{\\text{D}}=(4.5Ã{10}^{5}\\text{N})â(5.0Ã{10}^{6}\\text{kg})(7.5Ã{10}^{â2}{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=7.5Ã{10}^{4}\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nThe direction of\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{D}}{Fâ}_{\\text{D}}$\n\nhas already been determined to be in the direction opposite to\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{app}},{Fâ}_{\\text{app}},$\n\nor at an angle of\n\n$53\\text{Â°}53\\text{Â°}$\n\nsouth of west.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe numbers used in this example are reasonable for a moderately large barge. It is certainly difficult to obtain larger accelerations with tugboats, and small speeds are desirable to avoid running the barge into the docks. Drag is relatively small for a well-designed hull at low speeds, consistent with the answer to this example, where\n\n${F}_{\\text{D}}{F}_{\\text{D}}$\n\nis less than 1/600th of the weight of the ship.\n\nIn\n\nNewtonâs Laws of Motion\n\n, we discussed the\n\nnormal force\n\n, which is a contact force that acts normal to the surface so that an object does not have an acceleration perpendicular to the surface. The bathroom scale is an excellent example of a normal force acting on a body. It provides a quantitative reading of how much it must push upward to support the weight of an object. But can you predict what you would see on the dial of a bathroom scale if you stood on it during an\n\nelevator\n\nride? Will you see a value greater than your weight when the elevator starts up? What about when the elevator moves upward at a constant speed? Take a guess before reading the next example.\n\nExample\n\n6.3\n\nWhat Does the Bathroom Scale Read in an Elevator?\n\nFigure 6.5\n\nshows a 75.0-kg man (weight of about 165 lb.) standing on a bathroom scale in an elevator. Calculate the scale reading: (a) if the elevator accelerates upward at a rate of\n\n$1.20{\\text{m/s}}^{2},1.20{\\text{m/s}}^{2},$\n\nand (b) if the elevator moves upward at a constant speed of 1 m/s.\n\nFigure\n\n6.5\n\n(a) The various forces acting when a person stands on a bathroom scale in an elevator. The arrows are approximately correct for when the elevator is accelerating upwardâbroken arrows represent forces too large to be drawn to scale.\n\n$TâTâ$\n\nis the tension in the supporting cable,\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nis the weight of the person,\n\n${wâ}_{\\text{s}}{wâ}_{\\text{s}}$\n\nis the weight of the scale,\n\n${wâ}_{\\text{e}}{wâ}_{\\text{e}}$\n\nis the weight of the elevator,\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{s}}{Fâ}_{\\text{s}}$\n\nis the force of the scale on the person,\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{p}}{Fâ}_{\\text{p}}$\n\nis the force of the person on the scale,\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{t}}{Fâ}_{\\text{t}}$\n\nis the force of the scale on the floor of the elevator, and\n\n$NâNâ$\n\nis the force of the floor upward on the scale. (b) The free-body diagram shows only the external forces acting\n\non\n\nthe designated system of interestâthe personâand is the diagram we use for the solution of the problem.\n\nStrategy\n\nIf the scale at rest is accurate, its reading equals\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{p}}{Fâ}_{\\text{p}}$\n\n, the magnitude of the force the person exerts downward on it.\n\nFigure 6.5\n\n(a) shows the numerous forces acting on the elevator, scale, and person. It makes this one-dimensional problem look much more formidable than if the person is chosen to be the system of interest and a free-body diagram is drawn, as in\n\nFigure 6.5\n\n(b). Analysis of the free-body diagram using Newtonâs laws can produce answers to both\n\nFigure 6.5\n\n(a) and (b) of this example, as well as some other questions that might arise. The only forces acting on the person are his weight\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nand the upward force of the scale\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{s}}.{Fâ}_{\\text{s}}.$\n\nAccording to Newtonâs third law,\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{p}}{Fâ}_{\\text{p}}$\n\nand\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{s}}{Fâ}_{\\text{s}}$\n\nare equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so that we need to find\n\n${F}_{\\text{s}}{F}_{\\text{s}}$\n\nin order to find what the scale reads. We can do this, as usual, by applying Newtonâs second law,\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=maâ.{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}=maâ.$\n\nFrom the free-body diagram, we see that\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{net}}={Fâ}_{s}âwâ,{Fâ}_{\\text{net}}={Fâ}_{s}âwâ,$\n\nso we have\n\n${F}_{\\text{s}}âw=ma.{F}_{\\text{s}}âw=ma.$\n\nSolving for\n\n${F}_{s}{F}_{s}$\n\ngives us an equation with only one unknown:\n\n${F}_{\\text{s}}=ma+w,{F}_{\\text{s}}=ma+w,$\n\nor, because\n\n$w=mg,w=mg,$\n\nsimply\n\n${F}_{\\text{s}}=ma+mg.{F}_{\\text{s}}=ma+mg.$\n\nNo assumptions were made about the acceleration, so this solution should be valid for a variety of accelerations in addition to those in this situation. (\n\nNote:\n\nWe are considering the case when the elevator is accelerating upward. If the elevator is accelerating downward, Newtonâs second law becomes\n\n${F}_{s}âw=\\text{â}ma.{F}_{s}âw=\\text{â}ma.$\n\n)\n\nSolution\n\nWe have\n\n$a=1.20{\\text{m/s}}^{2},a=1.20{\\text{m/s}}^{2},$\n\nso that\n\n${F}_{\\text{s}}=(75.0\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})+(75.0\\text{kg})(1.20{\\text{m/s}}^{2}){F}_{\\text{s}}=(75.0\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})+(75.0\\text{kg})(1.20{\\text{m/s}}^{2})$\n\nyielding\n\n${F}_{\\text{s}}=825\\text{N}\\text{.}{F}_{\\text{s}}=825\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nNow, what happens when the elevator reaches a constant upward velocity? Will the scale still read more than his weight? For any constant velocityâup, down, or stationaryâacceleration is zero because\n\n$a=\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{\\text{Î}t}a=\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{\\text{Î}t}$\n\nand\n\n$\\text{Î}v=0.\\text{Î}v=0.$\n\nThus,\n\n${F}_{\\text{s}}=ma+mg=0+mg{F}_{\\text{s}}=ma+mg=0+mg$\n\nor\n\n${F}_{\\text{s}}=(75.0\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2}),{F}_{\\text{s}}=(75.0\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2}),$\n\nwhich gives\n\n${F}_{\\text{s}}=735\\text{N}\\text{.}{F}_{\\text{s}}=735\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nThe scale reading in\n\nFigure 6.5\n\n(a) is about 185 lb. What would the scale have read if he were stationary? Since his acceleration would be zero, the force of the scale would be equal to his weight:\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=ma=0={F}_{\\text{s}}âw{F}_{\\text{net}}=ma=0={F}_{\\text{s}}âw$\n\n${F}_{\\text{s}}=w=mg{F}_{\\text{s}}=w=mg$\n\n${F}_{\\text{s}}=(75.0\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=735\\text{N}\\text{.}{F}_{\\text{s}}=(75.0\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=735\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nThus, the scale reading in the elevator is greater than his 735-N (165-lb.) weight. This means that the scale is pushing up on the person with a force greater than his weight, as it must in order to accelerate him upward. Clearly, the greater the acceleration of the elevator, the greater the scale reading, consistent with what you feel in rapidly accelerating versus slowly accelerating elevators. In\n\nFigure 6.5\n\n(b), the scale reading is 735 N, which equals the personâs weight. This is the case whenever the elevator has a constant velocityâmoving up, moving down, or stationary.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n6.1\n\nNow calculate the scale reading when the elevator accelerates downward at a rate of\n\n$1.20{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.1.20{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.$\n\nThe solution to the previous example also applies to an elevator accelerating downward, as mentioned. When an elevator accelerates downward,\n\na\n\nis negative, and the scale reading is\n\nless\n\nthan the weight of the person. If a constant downward velocity is reached, the scale reading again becomes equal to the personâs weight. If the elevator is in free fall and accelerating downward at\n\ng\n\n, then the scale reading is zero and the person appears to be weightless.\n\nExample\n\n6.4\n\nTwo Attached Blocks\n\nFigure 6.6\n\nshows a block of mass\n\n${m}_{1}{m}_{1}$\n\non a frictionless, horizontal surface. It is pulled by a light string that passes over a frictionless and massless pulley. The other end of the string is connected to a block of mass\n\n${m}_{2}.{m}_{2}.$\n\nFind the acceleration of the blocks and the tension in the string in terms of\n\n${m}_{1},{m}_{2},\\text{and}g.{m}_{1},{m}_{2},\\text{and}g.$\n\nFigure\n\n6.6\n\n(a) Block 1 is connected by a light string to block 2. (b) The free-body diagrams of the blocks.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe draw a free-body diagram for each mass separately, as shown in\n\nFigure 6.6\n\n. Then we analyze each one to find the required unknowns. The forces on block 1 are the gravitational force, the contact force of the surface, and the tension in the string. Block 2 is subjected to the gravitational force and the string tension. Newtonâs second law applies to each, so we write two vector equations:\n\nFor block 1:\n\n$Tâ+{wâ}_{1}+Nâ={m}_{1}{aâ}_{1}Tâ+{wâ}_{1}+Nâ={m}_{1}{aâ}_{1}$\n\nFor block 2:\n\n$Tâ+{wâ}_{2}={m}_{2}{aâ}_{2}.Tâ+{wâ}_{2}={m}_{2}{aâ}_{2}.$\n\nNotice that\n\n$TâTâ$\n\nis the same for both blocks. Since the string and the pulley have negligible mass, and since there is no friction in the pulley, the tension is the same throughout the string. We can now write component equations for each block. All forces are either horizontal or vertical, so we can use the same horizontal/vertical coordinate system for both objects\n\nSolution\n\nThe component equations follow from the vector equations above. We see that block 1 has the vertical forces balanced, so we ignore them and write an equation relating the\n\nx\n\n-components. There are no horizontal forces on block 2, so only the\n\ny\n\n-equation is written. We obtain these results:\n\n$\\text{Block 1}\\text{Block 2}â{F}_{x}=m{a}_{x}â{F}_{y}=m{a}_{y}{T}_{x}={m}_{1}{a}_{1x}{T}_{y}â{m}_{2}g={m}_{2}{a}_{2y}.\\text{Block 1}\\text{Block 2}â{F}_{x}=m{a}_{x}â{F}_{y}=m{a}_{y}{T}_{x}={m}_{1}{a}_{1x}{T}_{y}â{m}_{2}g={m}_{2}{a}_{2y}.$\n\nWhen block 1 moves to the right, block 2 travels an equal distance downward; thus,\n\n${a}_{1x}=\\text{â}{a}_{2y}.{a}_{1x}=\\text{â}{a}_{2y}.$\n\nWriting the common acceleration of the blocks as\n\n$a={a}_{1x}=\\text{â}{a}_{2y},a={a}_{1x}=\\text{â}{a}_{2y},$\n\nwe now have\n\n$T={m}_{1}aT={m}_{1}a$\n\nand\n\n$Tâ{m}_{2}g=\\text{â}{m}_{2}a.Tâ{m}_{2}g=\\text{â}{m}_{2}a.$\n\nFrom these two equations, we can express\n\na\n\nand\n\nT\n\nin terms of the masses\n\n${m}_{1}\\text{and}{m}_{2},\\text{and}g:{m}_{1}\\text{and}{m}_{2},\\text{and}g:$\n\n$a=\\frac{{m}_{2}}{{m}_{1}+{m}_{2}}ga=\\frac{{m}_{2}}{{m}_{1}+{m}_{2}}g$\n\nand\n\n$T=\\frac{{m}_{1}{m}_{2}}{{m}_{1}+{m}_{2}}g.T=\\frac{{m}_{1}{m}_{2}}{{m}_{1}+{m}_{2}}g.$\n\nSignificance\n\nNotice that the tension in the string is\n\nless\n\nthan the weight of the block hanging from the end of it. A common error in problems like this is to set\n\n$T={m}_{2}g.T={m}_{2}g.$\n\nYou can see from the free-body diagram of block 2 that cannot be correct if the block is accelerating.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n6.2\n\nCalculate the acceleration of the system, and the tension in the string, when the masses are\n\n${m}_{1}=5.00\\text{kg}{m}_{1}=5.00\\text{kg}$\n\nand\n\n${m}_{2}=3.00\\text{kg}.{m}_{2}=3.00\\text{kg}.$\n\nExample\n\n6.5\n\nAtwood Machine\n\nA classic problem in physics, similar to the one we just solved, is that of the\n\nAtwood machine\n\n, which consists of a rope running over a pulley, with two objects of different mass attached. It is particularly useful in understanding the connection between force and motion. In\n\nFigure 6.7\n\n,\n\n${m}_{1}=2.00\\text{kg}{m}_{1}=2.00\\text{kg}$\n\nand\n\n${m}_{2}=4.00\\text{kg}\\text{.}{m}_{2}=4.00\\text{kg}\\text{.}$\n\nConsider the pulley to be frictionless. (a) If\n\n${m}_{2}{m}_{2}$\n\nis released, what will its acceleration be? (b) What is the tension in the string?\n\nFigure\n\n6.7\n\nAn Atwood machine and free-body diagrams for each of the two blocks.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe draw a free-body diagram for each mass separately, as shown in the figure. Then we analyze each diagram to find the required unknowns. This may involve the solution of simultaneous equations. It is also important to note the similarity with the previous example. As block 2 accelerates with acceleration\n\n${a}_{2}{a}_{2}$\n\nin the downward direction, block 1 accelerates upward with acceleration\n\n${a}_{1}{a}_{1}$\n\n. Thus,\n\n$a={a}_{1}=\\text{â}{a}_{2}.a={a}_{1}=\\text{â}{a}_{2}.$\n\nSolution\n\nWe have\n\n$\\text{For}{m}_{1},â{F}_{y}=Tâ{m}_{1}g={m}_{1}a.\\text{For}{m}_{2},â{F}_{y}=Tâ{m}_{2}g=\\text{â}{m}_{2}a.\\text{For}{m}_{1},â{F}_{y}=Tâ{m}_{1}g={m}_{1}a.\\text{For}{m}_{2},â{F}_{y}=Tâ{m}_{2}g=\\text{â}{m}_{2}a.$\n\n(The negative sign in front of\n\n${m}_{2}a{m}_{2}a$\n\nindicates that\n\n${m}_{2}{m}_{2}$\n\naccelerates downward; both blocks accelerate at the same rate, but in opposite directions.) Solve the two equations simultaneously (subtract them) and the result is\n\n$({m}_{2}â{m}_{1})g=({m}_{1}+{m}_{2})a.({m}_{2}â{m}_{1})g=({m}_{1}+{m}_{2})a.$\n\nSolving for\n\na\n\n:\n\n$a=\\frac{{m}_{2}â{m}_{1}}{{m}_{1}+{m}_{2}}g=\\frac{4\\text{kg}â2\\text{kg}}{4\\text{kg}+2\\text{kg}}(9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=3.27{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.a=\\frac{{m}_{2}â{m}_{1}}{{m}_{1}+{m}_{2}}g=\\frac{4\\text{kg}â2\\text{kg}}{4\\text{kg}+2\\text{kg}}(9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=3.27{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.$\n\nObserving the first block, we see that\n\n$Tâ{m}_{1}g={m}_{1}aT={m}_{1}(g+a)=(2\\text{kg})(9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2}+3.27{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=26.1\\text{N}\\text{.}Tâ{m}_{1}g={m}_{1}aT={m}_{1}(g+a)=(2\\text{kg})(9.8{\\text{m/s}}^{2}+3.27{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=26.1\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nThe result for the acceleration given in the solution can be interpreted as the ratio of the unbalanced force on the system,\n\n$({m}_{2}â{m}_{1})g({m}_{2}â{m}_{1})g$\n\n, to the total mass of the system,\n\n${m}_{1}+{m}_{2}{m}_{1}+{m}_{2}$\n\n. We can also use the Atwood machine to measure local gravitational field strength.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n6.3\n\nDetermine a general formula in terms of\n\n${m}_{1},{m}_{2}{m}_{1},{m}_{2}$\n\nand\n\ng\n\nfor calculating the tension in the string for the Atwood machine shown above.\n\nNewtonâs Laws of Motion and Kinematics\n\nPhysics is most interesting and most powerful when applied to general situations that involve more than a narrow set of physical principles. Newtonâs laws of motion can also be integrated with other concepts that have been discussed previously in this text to solve problems of motion. For example, forces produce accelerations, a topic of\n\nkinematics\n\n, and hence the relevance of earlier chapters.\n\nWhen approaching problems that involve various types of forces, acceleration, velocity, and/or position, listing the givens and the quantities to be calculated will allow you to identify the principles involved. Then, you can refer to the chapters that deal with a particular topic and solve the problem using strategies outlined in the text. The following worked example illustrates how the problem-solving strategy given earlier in this chapter, as well as strategies presented in other chapters, is applied to an integrated concept problem.\n\nExample\n\n6.6\n\nWhat Force Must a Soccer Player Exert to Reach Top Speed?\n\nA soccer player starts at rest and accelerates forward, reaching a velocity of 8.00 m/s in 2.50 s. (a) What is her average acceleration? (b) What average force does the ground exert forward on the runner so that she achieves this acceleration? The playerâs mass is 70.0 kg, and air resistance is negligible.\n\nStrategy\n\nTo find the answers to this problem, we use the problem-solving strategy given earlier in this chapter. The solutions to each part of the example illustrate how to apply specific problem-solving steps. In this case, we do not need to use all of the steps. We simply identify the physical principles, and thus the knowns and unknowns; apply Newtonâs second law; and check to see whether the answer is reasonable.\n\nSolution\n\nWe are given the initial and final velocities (zero and 8.00 m/s forward); thus, the change in velocity is\n\n$\\text{Î}v=8.00\\text{m/s}\\text{Î}v=8.00\\text{m/s}$\n\n. We are given the elapsed time, so\n\n$\\text{Î}t=2.50\\text{s}\\text{.}\\text{Î}t=2.50\\text{s}\\text{.}$\n\nThe unknown is acceleration, which can be found from its definition:\n\n$a=\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{\\text{Î}t}.a=\\frac{\\text{Î}v}{\\text{Î}t}.$\n\nSubstituting the known values yields\n\n$a=\\frac{8.00\\text{m/s}}{2.50\\text{s}}=3.20{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.a=\\frac{8.00\\text{m/s}}{2.50\\text{s}}=3.20{\\text{m/s}}^{2}.$\n\nHere we are asked to find the average force the ground exerts on the runner to produce this acceleration. (Remember that we are dealing with the force or forces acting on the object of interest.) This is the reaction force to that exerted by the player backward against the ground, by Newtonâs third law. Neglecting air resistance, this would be equal in magnitude to the net external force on the player, since this force causes her acceleration. Since we now know the playerâs acceleration and are given her mass, we can use Newtonâs second law to find the force exerted. That is,\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=ma.{F}_{\\text{net}}=ma.$\n\nSubstituting the known values of\n\nm\n\nand\n\na\n\ngives\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=(70.0\\text{kg})(3.20{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=224\\text{N}\\text{.}{F}_{\\text{net}}=(70.0\\text{kg})(3.20{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=224\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nThis is a reasonable result: The acceleration is attainable for an athlete in good condition. The force is about 50 pounds, a reasonable average force.\n\nSignificance\n\nThis example illustrates how to apply problem-solving strategies to situations that include topics from different chapters. The first step is to identify the physical principles, the knowns, and the unknowns involved in the problem. The second step is to solve for the unknown, in this case using Newtonâs second law. Finally, we check our answer to ensure it is reasonable. These techniques for integrated concept problems will be useful in applications of physics outside of a physics course, such as in your profession, in other science disciplines, and in everyday life.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n6.4\n\nThe soccer player stops after completing the play described above, but now notices that the ball is in position to be stolen.

We only need to consider motion in the horizontal direction. The vertical forces balance each other and it is not necessary to consider them. For part b, we make use of a free-body diagram of the tractor alone to determine the force between it and cart A.

Notice how the total mass of the system was important in solving\n\nFigure 6.8\n\n(a), whereas only the mass of the truck (since it supplied the force) was of use in\n\nFigure 6.8\n\n(b).\n\nRecall that\n\n$v=\\frac{ds}{dt}v=\\frac{ds}{dt}$\n\nand\n\n$a=\\frac{dv}{dt}a=\\frac{dv}{dt}$\n\n. If acceleration is a function of time, we can use the calculus forms developed in\n\nMotion Along a Straight Line\n\n, as shown in this example. However, sometimes acceleration is a function of displacement. In this case, we can derive an important result from these calculus relations. Solving for\n\ndt\n\nin each, we have\n\n$dt=\\frac{ds}{v}dt=\\frac{ds}{v}$\n\nand\n\n$dt=\\frac{dv}{a}.dt=\\frac{dv}{a}.$\n\nNow, equating these expressions, we have\n\n$\\frac{ds}{v}=\\frac{dv}{a}.\\frac{ds}{v}=\\frac{dv}{a}.$\n\nWe can rearrange this to obtain\n\n${a}^{}ds={v}^{}dv.{a}^{}ds={v}^{}dv.$\n\nExample\n\n6.9\n\nMotion of a Projectile Fired Vertically\n\nA 10.0-kg mortar shell is fired vertically upward from the ground, with an initial velocity of 50.0 m/s (see\n\nFigure 6.9\n\n).

(b) A free-body diagram is shown which indicates all the forces on the mortar shell. (credit a: modification of work by OS541/DoD; The appearance of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) visual information does not imply or constitute DoD endorsement.)\n\nStrategy\n\nThe known force on the mortar shell can be related to its acceleration using the equations of motion. Kinematics can then be used to relate the mortar shellâs acceleration to its position.\n\nSolution\n\nInitially,\n\n${y}_{0}=0{y}_{0}=0$\n\nand\n\n${v}_{0}=50.0\\text{m/s}\\text{.}{v}_{0}=50.0\\text{m/s}\\text{.}$\n\nAt the maximum height\n\n$y=h,v=0.y=h,v=0.$\n\nThe free-body diagram shows\n\n${F}_{\\text{D}}{F}_{\\text{D}}$\n\nto act downward, because it slows the upward motion of the mortar shell.

Since\n\n$a=f(v)\\text{,}a=f(v)\\text{,}$\n\nwe can relate\n\na\n\nto\n\nv\n\nusing the rearrangement described above,\n\n${a}^{}ds={v}^{}dv.{a}^{}ds={v}^{}dv.$\n\nWe replace\n\nds\n\nwith\n\ndy\n\nbecause we are dealing with the vertical direction,\n\n$ady=vdv,\\text{â}(â0.00100{v}^{2}â9.80)dy=vdv.ady=vdv,\\text{â}(â0.00100{v}^{2}â9.80)dy=vdv.$\n\nWe now separate the variables (\n\nv\n\nâs and\n\ndv\n\nâs on one side;\n\ndy\n\non the other):\n\n${â«}_{0}^{h}dy={â«}_{50.0}^{0}\\frac{vdv}{(â0.00100{v}^{2}â9.80)}{â«}_{0}^{h}dy=â{â«}_{50.0}^{0}\\frac{vdv}{(0.00100{v}^{2}+9.80)}=(â5Ã{10}^{2})\\text{ln}(0.00100{v}^{2}+9.80){|}_{50.0}^{0}.{â«}_{0}^{h}dy={â«}_{50.0}^{0}\\frac{vdv}{(â0.00100{v}^{2}â9.80)}{â«}_{0}^{h}dy=â{â«}_{50.0}^{0}\\frac{vdv}{(0.00100{v}^{2}+9.80)}=(â5Ã{10}^{2})\\text{ln}(0.00100{v}^{2}+9.80){|}_{50.0}^{0}.$\n\nThus,\n\n$h=114\\text{m}\\text{.}h=114\\text{m}\\text{.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nNotice the need to apply calculus since the force is not constant, which also means that acceleration is not constant.

This resistance is a force of friction. Friction opposes relative motion between systems in contact but also allows us to move, a concept that becomes obvious if you try to walk on ice. Friction is a common yet complex force, and its behavior still not completely understood. Still, it is possible to understand the circumstances in which it behaves.\n\nStatic and Kinetic Friction\n\nThe basic definition of\n\nfriction\n\nis relatively simple to state.\n\nFriction\n\nFriction is a force that opposes relative motion between systems in contact.\n\nThere are several forms of friction. One of the simpler characteristics of sliding friction is that it is parallel to the contact surfaces between systems and is always in a direction that opposes motion or attempted motion of the systems relative to each other. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called kinetic friction. For example, friction slows a hockey puck sliding on ice. When objects are stationary, static friction can act between them; the static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between two objects.\n\nStatic and Kinetic Friction\n\nIf two systems are in contact and stationary relative to one another, then the friction between them is called\n\nstatic friction\n\n. If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called\n\nkinetic friction\n\n.\n\nImagine, for example, trying to slide a heavy crate across a concrete floorâyou might push very hard on the crate and not move it at all. This means that the static friction responds to what you doâit increases to be equal to and in the opposite direction of your push. If you finally push hard enough, the crate seems to slip suddenly and starts to move. Now static friction gives way to kinetic friction. Once in motion, it is easier to keep it in motion than it was to get it started, indicating that the kinetic frictional force is less than the static frictional force. If you add mass to the crate, say by placing a box on top of it, you need to push even harder to get it started and also to keep it moving. Furthermore, if you oiled the concrete you would find it easier to get the crate started and keep it going (as you might expect).\n\nFigure 6.10\n\nis a crude pictorial representation of how friction occurs at the interface between two objects. Close-up inspection of these surfaces shows them to be rough. Thus, when you push to get an object moving (in this case, a crate), you must raise the object until it can skip along with just the tips of the surface hitting, breaking off the points, or both. A considerable force can be resisted by friction with no apparent motion. The harder the surfaces are pushed together (such as if another box is placed on the crate), the more force is needed to move them. Part of the friction is due to adhesive forces between the surface molecules of the two objects, which explains the dependence of friction on the nature of the substances. For example, rubber-soled shoes slip less than those with leather soles. Adhesion varies with substances in contact and is a complicated aspect of surface physics. Once an object is moving, there are fewer points of contact (fewer molecules adhering), so less force is required to keep the object moving. At small but nonzero speeds, friction is nearly independent of speed.\n\nFigure\n\n6.10\n\nFrictional forces, such as\n\n$fâ,fâ,$\n\nalways oppose motion or attempted motion between objects in contact. Friction arises in part because of the roughness of the surfaces in contact, as seen in the expanded view. For the object to move, it must rise to where the peaks of the top surface can skip along the bottom surface. Thus, a force is required just to set the object in motion. Some of the peaks will be broken off, also requiring a force to maintain motion. Much of the friction is actually due to attractive forces between molecules making up the two objects, so that even perfectly smooth surfaces are not friction-free. (In fact, perfectly smooth, clean surfaces of similar materials would adhere, forming a bond called a âcold weld.â)\n\nThe magnitude of the frictional force has two forms: one for static situations (static friction), the other for situations involving motion (kinetic friction). What follows is an approximate empirical (experimentally determined) model only. These equations for static and kinetic friction are not vector equations.\n\nMagnitude of Static Friction\n\nThe magnitude of static friction\n\n${f}_{\\text{s}}{f}_{\\text{s}}$\n\nis\n\n${f}_{\\text{s}}â¤{Î¼}_{\\text{s}}N,{f}_{\\text{s}}â¤{Î¼}_{\\text{s}}N,$\n\n6.1\n\nwhere\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{s}}{Î¼}_{\\text{s}}$\n\nis the\n\ncoefficient of static friction\n\nand\n\nN\n\nis the magnitude of the normal force.\n\nThe symbol\n\n$â¤â¤$\n\nmeans\n\nless than or equal to\n\n, implying that static friction can have a maximum value of\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{s}}N.{Î¼}_{\\text{s}}N.$\n\nStatic friction is a responsive force that increases to be equal and opposite to whatever force is exerted, up to its maximum limit.

The direction of friction is always opposite that of motion, parallel to the surface between objects, and perpendicular to the normal force. For example, if the crate you try to push (with a force parallel to the floor) has a mass of 100 kg, then the normal force is equal to its weight,\n\n$w=mg=(100\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=980\\text{N,}w=mg=(100\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=980\\text{N,}$\n\nperpendicular to the floor. If the coefficient of static friction is 0.45, you would have to exert a force parallel to the floor greater than\n\n${f}_{\\text{s}}(\\text{max})={Î¼}_{\\text{s}}N=(0.45)(980\\text{N})=440\\text{N}{f}_{\\text{s}}(\\text{max})={Î¼}_{\\text{s}}N=(0.45)(980\\text{N})=440\\text{N}$\n\nto move the crate. Once there is motion, friction is less and the coefficient of kinetic friction might be 0.30, so that a force of only\n\n${f}_{\\text{k}}={Î¼}_{\\text{k}}N=(0.30)(980\\text{N})=290\\text{N}{f}_{\\text{k}}={Î¼}_{\\text{k}}N=(0.30)(980\\text{N})=290\\text{N}$\n\nkeeps it moving at a constant speed. If the floor is lubricated, both coefficients are considerably less than they would be without lubrication. Coefficient of friction is a unitless quantity with a magnitude usually between 0 and 1.0. The actual value depends on the two surfaces that are in contact.\n\nMany people have experienced the slipperiness of walking on ice. However, many parts of the body, especially the joints, have much smaller coefficients of frictionâoften three or four times less than ice. A joint is formed by the ends of two bones, which are connected by thick tissues. The knee joint is formed by the lower leg bone (the tibia) and the thighbone (the femur). The hip is a ball (at the end of the femur) and socket (part of the pelvis) joint. The ends of the bones in the joint are covered by cartilage, which provides a smooth, almost-glassy surface. The joints also produce a fluid (synovial fluid) that reduces friction and wear. A damaged or arthritic joint can be replaced by an\n\nartificial joint\n\n(\n\nFigure 6.12\n\n). These replacements can be made of metals (stainless steel or titanium) or plastic (polyethylene), also with very small coefficients of friction.\n\nFigure\n\n6.12\n\nArtificial knee replacement is a procedure that has been performed for more than 20 years. These post-operative X-rays show a right knee joint replacement.

Hospitals and doctorâs clinics commonly use artificial lubricants, such as gels, to reduce friction.\n\nThe equations given for static and kinetic friction are empirical laws that describe the behavior of the forces of friction. While these formulas are very useful for practical purposes, they do not have the status of mathematical statements that represent general principles (e.g., Newtonâs second law). In fact, there are cases for which these equations are not even good approximations. For instance, neither formula is accurate for lubricated surfaces or for two surfaces sliding across each other at high speeds. Unless specified, we will not be concerned with these exceptions.\n\nExample\n\n6.10\n\nStatic and Kinetic Friction\n\nA 20.0-kg crate is at rest on a floor as shown in\n\nFigure 6.13\n\n. The coefficient of static friction between the crate and floor is 0.700 and the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.600. A horizontal force\n\n$PâPâ$\n\nis applied to the crate.

Here,\n\n$fâfâ$\n\nmay represent either the static or the kinetic frictional force.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe free-body diagram of the crate is shown in\n\nFigure 6.13\n\n(b). We apply Newtonâs second law in the horizontal and vertical directions, including the friction force in opposition to the direction of motion of the box.\n\nSolution\n\nNewtonâs second law GIVES\n\n$â{F}_{x}=m{a}_{x}â{F}_{y}=m{a}_{y}Pâf=m{a}_{x}Nâw=0.â{F}_{x}=m{a}_{x}â{F}_{y}=m{a}_{y}Pâf=m{a}_{x}Nâw=0.$\n\nHere we are using the symbol\n\nf\n\nto represent the frictional force since we have not yet determined whether the crate is subject to station friction or kinetic friction. We do this whenever we are unsure what type of friction is acting. Now the weight of the crate is\n\n$w=(20.0\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=196\\text{N,}w=(20.0\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=196\\text{N,}$\n\nwhich is also equal to\n\nN\n\n. The maximum force of static friction is therefore\n\n$(0.700)(196\\text{N})=137\\text{N}\\text{.}(0.700)(196\\text{N})=137\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nAs long as\n\n$PâPâ$\n\nis less than 137 N, the force of static friction keeps the crate stationary and\n\n${f}_{\\text{s}}=Pâ.{f}_{\\text{s}}=Pâ.$\n\nThus, (a)\n\n${f}_{s}=20.0\\text{N,}{f}_{s}=20.0\\text{N,}$\n\n(b)\n\n${f}_{s}=30.0\\text{N,}{f}_{s}=30.0\\text{N,}$\n\nand (c)\n\n${f}_{s}=120.0\\text{N}\\text{.}{f}_{s}=120.0\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\n(d) If\n\n$Pâ=180.0\\text{N,}Pâ=180.0\\text{N,}$\n\nthe applied force is greater than the maximum force of static friction (137 N), so the crate can no longer remain at rest. Once the crate is in motion, kinetic friction acts. Then\n\n${f}_{\\text{k}}={Î¼}_{\\text{k}}N=(0.600)(196\\text{N})=118\\text{N,}{f}_{\\text{k}}={Î¼}_{\\text{k}}N=(0.600)(196\\text{N})=118\\text{N,}$\n\nand the acceleration is\n\n${a}_{x}=\\frac{Pâ{f}_{\\text{k}}}{m}=\\frac{180.0\\text{N}â118\\text{N}}{20.0\\text{kg}}=3.10{\\text{m/s}}^{2}\\text{.}{a}_{x}=\\frac{Pâ{f}_{\\text{k}}}{m}=\\frac{180.0\\text{N}â118\\text{N}}{20.0\\text{kg}}=3.10{\\text{m/s}}^{2}\\text{.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nThis example illustrates how we consider friction in a dynamics problem. Notice that static friction has a value that matches the applied force, until we reach the maximum value of static friction. Also, no motion can occur until the applied force equals the force of static friction, but the force of kinetic friction will then become smaller.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n6.7\n\nA block of mass 1.0 kg rests on a horizontal surface. The frictional coefficients for the block and surface are\n\n${Î¼}_{s}=0.50{Î¼}_{s}=0.50$\n\nand\n\n${Î¼}_{k}=0.40.{Î¼}_{k}=0.40.$\n\n(a) What is the minimum horizontal force required to move the block? (b) What is the blockâs acceleration when this force is applied?\n\nFriction and the Inclined Plane\n\nOne situation where friction plays an obvious role is that of an object on a slope. It might be a crate being pushed up a ramp to a loading dock or a skateboarder coasting down a mountain, but the basic physics is the same. We usually generalize the sloping surface and call it an\n\ninclined plane\n\nbut then pretend that the surface is flat. Letâs look at an example of analyzing motion on an inclined plane with friction.\n\nExample\n\n6.11\n\nDownhill Skier\n\nA skier with a mass of 62 kg is sliding down a snowy slope at a constant acceleration. Find the coefficient of kinetic friction for the skier if friction is known to be 45.0 N.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe magnitude of kinetic friction is given as 45.0 N. Kinetic friction is related to the normal force\n\n$NN$\n\nby\n\n${f}_{\\text{k}}={Î¼}_{\\text{k}}N{f}_{\\text{k}}={Î¼}_{\\text{k}}N$\n\n; thus, we can find the coefficient of kinetic friction if we can find the normal force on the skier. The normal force is always perpendicular to the surface, and since there is no motion perpendicular to the surface, the normal force should equal the component of the skierâs weight perpendicular to the slope. (See\n\nFigure 6.14\n\n, which repeats a figure from the chapter on Newtonâs laws of motion.)\n\nFigure\n\n6.14\n\nThe motion of the skier and friction are parallel to the slope, so it is most convenient to project all forces onto a coordinate system where one axis is parallel to the slope and the other is perpendicular (axes shown to left of skier). The normal force\n\n$NâNâ$\n\nis perpendicular to the slope, and friction\n\n$fâfâ$\n\nis parallel to the slope, but the skierâs weight\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nhas components along both axes, namely\n\n${wâ}_{y}{wâ}_{y}$\n\nand\n\n${wâ}_{x}.{wâ}_{x}.$\n\nThe normal force\n\n$NâNâ$\n\nis equal in magnitude to\n\n${wâ}_{y},{wâ}_{y},$\n\nso there is no motion perpendicular to the slope.\n\nWe have\n\n$N={w}_{y}=w\\text{cos}25\\text{Â°}=mg\\text{cos}25\\text{Â°}.N={w}_{y}=w\\text{cos}25\\text{Â°}=mg\\text{cos}25\\text{Â°}.$\n\nSubstituting this into our expression for kinetic friction, we obtain\n\n${f}_{\\text{k}}={Î¼}_{\\text{k}}mg\\text{cos}25\\text{Â°},{f}_{\\text{k}}={Î¼}_{\\text{k}}mg\\text{cos}25\\text{Â°},$\n\nwhich can now be solved for the coefficient of kinetic friction\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{k}}.{Î¼}_{\\text{k}}.$\n\nSolution\n\nSolving for\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{k}}{Î¼}_{\\text{k}}$\n\ngives\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{k}}=\\frac{{f}_{\\text{k}}}{N}=\\frac{{f}_{\\text{k}}}{w\\text{cos}25\\text{Â°}}=\\frac{{f}_{\\text{k}}}{mg\\text{cos}25\\text{Â°}}.{Î¼}_{\\text{k}}=\\frac{{f}_{\\text{k}}}{N}=\\frac{{f}_{\\text{k}}}{w\\text{cos}25\\text{Â°}}=\\frac{{f}_{\\text{k}}}{mg\\text{cos}25\\text{Â°}}.$\n\nSubstituting known values on the right-hand side of the equation,\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{k}}=\\frac{45.0\\text{N}}{(62\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})(0.906)}=0.082.{Î¼}_{\\text{k}}=\\frac{45.0\\text{N}}{(62\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})(0.906)}=0.082.$\n\nSignificance\n\nThis result is a little smaller than the coefficient listed in\n\nTable 6.1\n\nfor waxed wood on snow, but it is still reasonable since values of the coefficients of friction can vary greatly. In situations like this, where an object of mass\n\nm\n\nslides down a slope that makes an angle\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\nwith the horizontal, friction is given by\n\n${f}_{\\text{k}}={Î¼}_{\\text{k}}mg\\text{cos}Î¸.{f}_{\\text{k}}={Î¼}_{\\text{k}}mg\\text{cos}Î¸.$\n\nAll objects slide down a slope with constant acceleration under these circumstances.\n\nWe have discussed that when an object rests on a horizontal surface, the normal force supporting it is equal in magnitude to its weight. Furthermore, simple friction is always proportional to the normal force. When an object is not on a horizontal surface, as with the inclined plane, we must find the force acting on the object that is directed perpendicular to the surface; it is a component of the weight.\n\nWe now derive a useful relationship for calculating coefficient of friction on an inclined plane. Notice that the result applies only for situations in which the object slides at constant speed down the ramp.\n\nAn object slides down an inclined plane at a constant velocity if the net force on the object is zero. We can use this fact to measure the coefficient of kinetic friction between two objects. As shown in\n\nExample 6.11\n\n, the kinetic friction on a slope is\n\n${f}_{k}={Î¼}_{k}mg\\text{cos}Î¸{f}_{k}={Î¼}_{k}mg\\text{cos}Î¸$\n\n. The component of the weight down the slope is equal to\n\n$mg\\text{sin}Î¸mg\\text{sin}Î¸$\n\n(see the free-body diagram in\n\nFigure 6.14\n\n). These forces act in opposite directions, so when they have equal magnitude, the acceleration is zero. Writing these out,\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{k}}mg\\text{cos}Î¸=mg\\text{sin}Î¸.{Î¼}_{\\text{k}}mg\\text{cos}Î¸=mg\\text{sin}Î¸.$\n\nSolving for\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{k}},{Î¼}_{\\text{k}},$\n\nwe find that\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{k}}=\\frac{mg\\text{sin}Î¸}{mg\\text{cos}Î¸}=\\text{tan}Î¸.{Î¼}_{\\text{k}}=\\frac{mg\\text{sin}Î¸}{mg\\text{cos}Î¸}=\\text{tan}Î¸.$\n\nPut a coin on a book and tilt it until the coin slides at a constant velocity down the book. You might need to tap the book lightly to get the coin to move. Measure the angle of tilt relative to the horizontal and find\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{k}}.{Î¼}_{\\text{k}}.$\n\nNote that the coin does not start to slide at all until an angle greater than\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\nis attained, since the coefficient of static friction is larger than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Think about how this may affect the value for\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{k}}{Î¼}_{\\text{k}}$\n\nand its uncertainty.\n\nAtomic-Scale Explanations of Friction\n\nThe simpler aspects of friction dealt with so far are its macroscopic (large-scale) characteristics. Great strides have been made in the atomic-scale explanation of friction during the past several decades. Researchers are finding that the atomic nature of friction seems to have several fundamental characteristics. These characteristics not only explain some of the simpler aspects of frictionâthey also hold the potential for the development of nearly friction-free environments that could save hundreds of billions of dollars in energy which is currently being converted (unnecessarily) into heat.\n\nFigure 6.15\n\nillustrates one macroscopic characteristic of friction that is explained by microscopic (small-scale) research. We have noted that friction is proportional to the normal force, but not to the amount of area in contact, a somewhat counterintuitive notion. When two rough surfaces are in contact, the actual contact area is a tiny fraction of the total area because only high spots touch. When a greater normal force is exerted, the actual contact area increases, and we find that the friction is proportional to this area.\n\nFigure\n\n6.15\n\nTwo rough surfaces in contact have a much smaller area of actual contact than their total area. When the normal force is larger as a result of a larger applied force, the area of actual contact increases, as does friction.\n\nHowever, the atomic-scale view promises to explain far more than the simpler features of friction. The mechanism for how heat is generated is now being determined. In other words, why do surfaces get warmer when rubbed? Essentially, atoms are linked with one another to form lattices. When surfaces rub, the surface atoms adhere and cause atomic lattices to vibrateâessentially creating sound waves that penetrate the material. The sound waves diminish with distance, and their energy is converted into heat. Chemical reactions that are related to frictional wear can also occur between atoms and molecules on the surfaces.\n\nFigure 6.16\n\nshows how the tip of a probe drawn across another material is deformed by atomic-scale friction. The force needed to drag the tip can be measured and is found to be related to\n\nshear stress\n\n, which is discussed in\n\nStatic Equilibrium and Elasticity\n\n. The variation in shear stress is remarkable (more than a factor of\n\n${10}^{12}{10}^{12}$\n\n) and difficult to predict theoretically, but shear stress is yielding a fundamental understanding of a large-scale phenomenon known since ancient timesâfriction.\n\nFigure\n\n6.16\n\nThe tip of a probe is deformed sideways by frictional force as the probe is dragged across a surface. Measurements of how the force varies for different materials are yielding fundamental insights into the atomic nature of friction.\n\nInteractive\n\nEngaging the simulation below, describe a model for friction on a molecular level. Describe matter in terms of molecular motion. The description should include diagrams to support the description; how the temperature affects the image; what are the differences and similarities between solid, liquid, and gas particle motion; and how the size and speed of gas molecules relate to everyday objects.\n\nAccess multimedia content\n\nExample\n\n6.12\n\nSliding Blocks\n\nThe two blocks of\n\nFigure 6.17\n\nare attached to each other by a massless string that is wrapped around a frictionless pulley.

Find the magnitude of the force necessary to move the blocks at constant speed. Assume that the coefficient of kinetic friction between all surfaces is 0.400.\n\nFigure\n\n6.17\n\n(a) Each block moves at constant velocity. (b) Free-body diagrams for the blocks.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe analyze the motions of the two blocks separately. The top block is subjected to a contact force exerted by the bottom block. The components of this force are the normal force\n\n${N}_{1}{N}_{1}$\n\nand the frictional force\n\n$â0.400{N}_{1}.â0.400{N}_{1}.$\n\nOther forces on the top block are the tension\n\n$TT$\n\nin the string and the weight of the top block itself, 19.6 N. The bottom block is subjected to contact forces due to the top block and due to the floor.

The maximum value of the force of static friction is\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{s}}N=(0.400)(4.90Ã{10}^{2}\\text{N})=196\\text{N,}{Î¼}_{\\text{s}}N=(0.400)(4.90Ã{10}^{2}\\text{N})=196\\text{N,}$\n\nwhereas the\n\nactual\n\nforce of static friction that acts when the truck accelerates forward at\n\n$2.00{\\text{m/s}}^{2}2.00{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\nis only\n\n$1.00Ã{10}^{2}\\text{N}\\text{.}1.00Ã{10}^{2}\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nThus, the assumption of no slipping is valid.\n\nIf the crate is to move with the truck when it accelerates at\n\n$5.0{\\text{m/s}}^{2},5.0{\\text{m/s}}^{2},$\n\nthe force of static friction must be\n\n${f}_{\\text{s}}=m{a}_{x}=(50.0\\text{kg})(5.00{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=250\\text{N}\\text{.}{f}_{\\text{s}}=m{a}_{x}=(50.0\\text{kg})(5.00{\\text{m/s}}^{2})=250\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nSince this exceeds the maximum of 196 N, the crate must slip.

Because she moves along the slope, the most convenient reference frame for analyzing her motion is one with the\n\nx\n\n-axis along and the\n\ny\n\n-axis perpendicular to the incline.

    "content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nExplain the equation for centripetal acceleration\n\nApply Newtonâs second law to develop the equation for centripetal force\n\nUse circular motion concepts in solving problems involving Newtonâs laws of motion\n\nIn\n\nMotion in Two and Three Dimensions\n\n, we examined the basic concepts of circular motion. An object undergoing circular motion, like one of the race cars shown at the beginning of this chapter, must be accelerating because it is changing the direction of its velocity. We proved that this centrally directed acceleration, called\n\ncentripetal acceleration\n\n, is given by the formula\n\n${a}_{\\text{c}}=\\frac{{v}^{2}}{r}{a}_{\\text{c}}=\\frac{{v}^{2}}{r}$\n\nwhere\n\nv\n\nis the velocity of the object, directed along a tangent line to the curve at any instant. If we know the angular velocity\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\n, then we can use\n\n${a}_{\\text{c}}=r{Ï}^{2}.{a}_{\\text{c}}=r{Ï}^{2}.$\n\nAngular velocity gives the rate at which the object is turning through the curve, in units of rad/s. This acceleration acts along the radius of the curved path and is thus also referred to as a radial acceleration.\n\nAn acceleration must be produced by a force. Any force or combination of forces can cause a centripetal or radial acceleration. Just a few examples are the tension in the rope on a tether ball, the force of Earthâs gravity on the Moon, friction between roller skates and a rink floor, a banked roadwayâs force on a car, and forces on the tube of a spinning centrifuge. Any net force causing uniform circular motion is called a\n\ncentripetal force\n\n. The direction of a centripetal force is toward the center of curvature, the same as the direction of centripetal acceleration. According to Newtonâs second law of motion, net force is mass times acceleration:\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=ma.{F}_{\\text{net}}=ma.$\n\nFor uniform circular motion, the acceleration is the centripetal acceleration:\n\n.\n\n$a={a}_{\\text{c}}.a={a}_{\\text{c}}.$\n\nThus, the magnitude of centripetal force\n\n${F}_{\\text{c}}{F}_{\\text{c}}$\n\nis\n\n${F}_{\\text{c}}=m{a}_{\\text{c}}.{F}_{\\text{c}}=m{a}_{\\text{c}}.$\n\nBy substituting the expressions for centripetal acceleration\n\n${a}_{\\text{c}}{a}_{\\text{c}}$\n\n$({a}_{\\text{c}}=\\frac{{v}^{2}}{r};{a}_{\\text{c}}=r{Ï}^{2}),({a}_{\\text{c}}=\\frac{{v}^{2}}{r};{a}_{\\text{c}}=r{Ï}^{2}),$\n\nwe get two expressions for the centripetal force\n\n${F}_{\\text{c}}{F}_{\\text{c}}$\n\nin terms of mass, velocity, angular velocity, and radius of curvature:\n\n${F}_{\\text{c}}=m\\frac{{v}^{2}}{r};{F}_{\\text{c}}=mr{Ï}^{2}.{F}_{\\text{c}}=m\\frac{{v}^{2}}{r};{F}_{\\text{c}}=mr{Ï}^{2}.$\n\n6.3\n\nYou may use whichever expression for centripetal force is more convenient. Centripetal force\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{c}}{Fâ}_{\\text{c}}$\n\nis always perpendicular to the path and points to the center of curvature, because\n\n${aâ}_{\\text{c}}{aâ}_{\\text{c}}$\n\nis perpendicular to the velocity and points to the center of curvature. Note that if you solve the first expression for\n\nr\n\n, you get\n\n$r=\\frac{m{v}^{2}}{{F}_{\\text{c}}}.r=\\frac{m{v}^{2}}{{F}_{\\text{c}}}.$\n\nThis implies that for a given mass and velocity, a large centripetal force causes a small radius of curvatureâthat is, a tight curve, as in\n\nFigure 6.20\n\n.\n\nFigure\n\n6.20\n\nThe frictional force supplies the centripetal force and is numerically equal to it. Centripetal force is perpendicular to velocity and causes uniform circular motion. The larger the\n\n${F}_{\\text{c}},{F}_{\\text{c}},$\n\nthe smaller the radius of curvature\n\nr\n\nand the sharper the curve. The second curve has the same\n\nv\n\n, but a larger\n\n${F}_{\\text{c}}{F}_{\\text{c}}$\n\nproduces a smaller\n\nr\n\nâ².\n\nExample\n\n6.15\n\nWhat Coefficient of Friction Do Cars Need on a Flat Curve?\n\n(a) Calculate the centripetal force exerted on a 900.0-kg car that negotiates a 500.0-m radius curve at 25.00 m/s. (b) Assuming an unbanked curve, find the minimum static coefficient of friction between the tires and the road, static friction being the reason that keeps the car from slipping (\n\nFigure 6.21\n\n).\n\nFigure\n\n6.21\n\nThis car on level ground is moving away and turning to the left. The centripetal force causing the car to turn in a circular path is due to friction between the tires and the road. A minimum coefficient of friction is needed, or the car will move in a larger-radius curve and leave the roadway.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe know that\n\n${F}_{\\text{c}}=\\frac{m{v}^{2}}{r}.{F}_{\\text{c}}=\\frac{m{v}^{2}}{r}.$\n\nThus,\n\n${F}_{\\text{c}}=\\frac{m{v}^{2}}{r}=\\frac{(900.0\\text{kg}){(25.00\\text{m/s})}^{2}}{(500.0\\text{m})}=1125\\text{N}\\text{.}{F}_{\\text{c}}=\\frac{m{v}^{2}}{r}=\\frac{(900.0\\text{kg}){(25.00\\text{m/s})}^{2}}{(500.0\\text{m})}=1125\\text{N}\\text{.}$\n\nFigure 6.21\n\nshows the forces acting on the car on an unbanked (level ground) curve. Friction is to the left, keeping the car from slipping, and because it is the only horizontal force acting on the car, the friction is the centripetal force in this case. We know that the maximum static friction (at which the tires roll but do not slip) is\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{s}}N,{Î¼}_{\\text{s}}N,$\n\nwhere\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{s}}{Î¼}_{\\text{s}}$\n\nis the static coefficient of friction and\n\nN\n\nis the normal force. The normal force equals the carâs weight on level ground, so\n\n$N=mg.N=mg.$\n\nThus the centripetal force in this situation is\n\n${F}_{\\text{c}}â¡f={Î¼}_{\\text{s}}N={Î¼}_{\\text{s}}mg.{F}_{\\text{c}}â¡f={Î¼}_{\\text{s}}N={Î¼}_{\\text{s}}mg.$\n\nNow we have a relationship between centripetal force and the coefficient of friction. Using the equation\n\n${F}_{\\text{c}}=m\\frac{{v}^{2}}{r},{F}_{\\text{c}}=m\\frac{{v}^{2}}{r},$\n\nwe obtain\n\n$m\\frac{{v}^{2}}{r}={Î¼}_{\\text{s}}mg.m\\frac{{v}^{2}}{r}={Î¼}_{\\text{s}}mg.$\n\nWe solve this for\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{s}},{Î¼}_{\\text{s}},$\n\nnoting that mass cancels, and obtain\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{s}}=\\frac{{v}^{2}}{rg}.{Î¼}_{\\text{s}}=\\frac{{v}^{2}}{rg}.$\n\nSubstituting the knowns,\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{s}}=\\frac{{(25.00\\text{m/s})}^{2}}{(500.0\\text{m})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})}=0.13.{Î¼}_{\\text{s}}=\\frac{{(25.00\\text{m/s})}^{2}}{(500.0\\text{m})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})}=0.13.$\n\n(Because coefficients of friction are approximate, the answer is given to only two digits.)\n\nSignificance\n\nThe coefficient of friction found in\n\nFigure 6.21\n\n(b) is much smaller than is typically found between tires and roads. The car still negotiates the curve if the coefficient is greater than 0.13, because static friction is a responsive force, able to assume a value less than but no more than\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{s}}N.{Î¼}_{\\text{s}}N.$\n\nA higher coefficient would also allow the car to negotiate the curve at a higher speed, but if the coefficient of friction is less, the safe speed would be less than 25 m/s. Note that mass cancels, implying that, in this example, it does not matter how heavily loaded the car is to negotiate the turn. Mass cancels because friction is assumed proportional to the normal force, which in turn is proportional to mass. If the surface of the road were banked, the normal force would be greater, as discussed next.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n6.9\n\nA car moving at 96.8 km/h travels around a circular curve of radius 182.9 m on a flat country road. What must be the minimum coefficient of static friction to keep the car from slipping?\n\nBanked Curves\n\nLet us now consider\n\nbanked curve\n\ns\n\n, where the slope of the road helps you negotiate the curve (\n\nFigure 6.22\n\n). The greater the angle\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\n, the faster you can take the curve. Race tracks for bikes as well as cars, for example, often have steeply banked curves. In an âideally banked curve,â the angle\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\nis such that you can negotiate the curve at a certain speed without the aid of friction between the tires and the road. We will derive an expression for\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\nfor an ideally banked curve and consider an example related to it.\n\nFigure\n\n6.22\n\nThe car on this banked curve is moving away and turning to the left.\n\nFor\n\nideal banking\n\n, the net external force equals the horizontal centripetal force in the absence of friction. The components of the normal force\n\nN\n\nin the horizontal and vertical directions must equal the centripetal force and the weight of the car, respectively. In cases in which forces are not parallel, it is most convenient to consider components along perpendicular axesâin this case, the vertical and horizontal directions.\n\nFigure 6.22\n\nshows a free-body diagram for a car on a frictionless banked curve. If the angle\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\nis ideal for the speed and radius, then the net external force equals the necessary centripetal force. The only two external forces acting on the car are its weight\n\n$wâwâ$\n\nand the normal force of the road\n\n$Nâ.Nâ.$\n\n(A frictionless surface can only exert a force perpendicular to the surfaceâthat is, a normal force.) These two forces must add to give a net external force that is horizontal toward the center of curvature and has magnitude\n\n$m{v}^{2}\\text{/}r.m{v}^{2}\\text{/}r.$\n\nBecause this is the crucial force and it is horizontal, we use a coordinate system with vertical and horizontal axes. Only the normal force has a horizontal component, so this must equal the centripetal force, that is,\n\n$N\\text{sin}Î¸=\\frac{m{v}^{2}}{r}.N\\text{sin}Î¸=\\frac{m{v}^{2}}{r}.$\n\nBecause the car does not leave the surface of the road, the net vertical force must be zero, meaning that the vertical components of the two external forces must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. From\n\nFigure 6.22\n\n, we see that the vertical component of the normal force is\n\n$N\\text{cos}Î¸,N\\text{cos}Î¸,$\n\nand the only other vertical force is the carâs weight. These must be equal in magnitude; thus,\n\n$N\\text{cos}Î¸=mg.N\\text{cos}Î¸=mg.$\n\nNow we can combine these two equations to eliminate\n\nN\n\nand get an expression for\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\n, as desired. Solving the second equation for\n\n$N=mg\\text{/}(cosÎ¸)N=mg\\text{/}(cosÎ¸)$\n\nand substituting this into the first yields\n\n$mg\\frac{\\text{sin}Î¸}{\\text{cos}Î¸}=\\frac{m{v}^{2}}{r}mg\\text{tan}Î¸=\\frac{m{v}^{2}}{r}\\text{tan}Î¸=\\frac{{v}^{2}}{rg}.mg\\frac{\\text{sin}Î¸}{\\text{cos}Î¸}=\\frac{m{v}^{2}}{r}mg\\text{tan}Î¸=\\frac{m{v}^{2}}{r}\\text{tan}Î¸=\\frac{{v}^{2}}{rg}.$\n\nTaking the inverse tangent gives\n\n$Î¸={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{{v}^{2}}{rg}).Î¸={\\text{tan}}^{â1}(\\frac{{v}^{2}}{rg}).$\n\n6.4\n\nThis expression can be understood by considering how\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\ndepends on\n\nv\n\nand\n\nr\n\n. A large\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\nis obtained for a large\n\nv\n\nand a small\n\nr.\n\nThat is, roads must be steeply banked for high speeds and sharp curves. Friction helps, because it allows you to take the curve at greater or lower speed than if the curve were frictionless. Note that\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\ndoes not depend on the mass of the vehicle.\n\nExample\n\n6.16\n\nWhat Is the Ideal Speed to Take a Steeply Banked Tight Curve?\n\nCurves on some test tracks and race courses, such as Daytona International Speedway in Florida, are very steeply banked. This banking, with the aid of tire friction and very stable car configurations, allows the curves to be taken at very high speed. To illustrate, calculate the speed at which a 100.0-m radius curve banked at\n\n$31.0\\text{Â°}31.0\\text{Â°}$\n\nshould be driven if the road were frictionless.\n\nStrategy\n\nWe first note that all terms in the expression for the ideal angle of a banked curve except for speed are known; thus, we need only rearrange it so that speed appears on the left-hand side and then substitute known quantities.\n\nSolution\n\nStarting with\n\n$\\text{tan}Î¸=\\frac{{v}^{2}}{rg},\\text{tan}Î¸=\\frac{{v}^{2}}{rg},$\n\nwe get\n\n$v=\\sqrt{rg\\text{tan}Î¸}.v=\\sqrt{rg\\text{tan}Î¸}.$\n\nNoting that\n\n$\\text{tan}31.0\\text{Â°}=0.6009,\\text{tan}31.0\\text{Â°}=0.6009,$\n\nwe obtain\n\n$v=\\sqrt{(100.0\\text{m})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})(0.609)}=24.3\\text{m/s}\\text{.}v=\\sqrt{(100.0\\text{m})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})(0.609)}=24.3\\text{m/s}\\text{.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nThis is just about 87.5 km/h, consistent with a very steeply banked and rather sharp curve. Tire friction enables a vehicle to take the curve at significantly higher speeds.\n\nAirplanes also make turns by banking. The lift force, due to the force of the air on the wing, acts at right angles to the wing. When the airplane banks, the pilot is obtaining greater lift than necessary for level flight. The vertical component of lift balances the airplaneâs weight, and the horizontal component accelerates the plane. The banking angle shown in\n\nFigure 6.23\n\nis given by\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\n. We analyze the forces in the same way we treat the case of the car rounding a banked curve.\n\nFigure\n\n6.23\n\nIn a banked turn, the horizontal component of lift is unbalanced and accelerates the plane. The normal component of lift balances the planeâs weight. The banking angle is given by\n\n$Î¸Î¸$\n\n.

This simplified\n\nmodel of a carousel\n\ndemonstrates this force.\n\nInertial Forces and Noninertial (Accelerated) Frames: The Coriolis Force\n\nWhat do taking off in a jet airplane, turning a corner in a car, riding a merry-go-round, and the circular motion of a tropical cyclone have in common? Each exhibits inertial forcesâfictitious forces that merely seem to arise from motion, because the observerâs frame of reference is accelerating or rotating. When taking off in a jet, most people would agree it feels as if you are being pushed back into the seat as the airplane accelerates down the runway. Yet a physicist would say that\n\nyou\n\ntend to remain stationary while the\n\nseat\n\npushes forward on you. An even more common experience occurs when you make a tight curve in your carâsay, to the right (\n\nFigure 6.24\n\n). You feel as if you are thrown (that is,\n\nforced\n\n) toward the left relative to the car. Again, a physicist would say that\n\nyou\n\nare going in a straight line (recall Newtonâs first law) but the\n\ncar\n\nmoves to the right, not that you are experiencing a force from the left.\n\nFigure\n\n6.24\n\n(a) The car driver feels herself forced to the left relative to the car when she makes a right turn. This is a fictitious inertial force arising from the use of the car as a frame of reference. (b) In Earthâs frame of reference, the driver moves in a straight line, obeying Newtonâs first law, and the car moves to the right. There is no force to the left on the driver relative to Earth. Instead, there is a force to the right on the car to make it turn.\n\nWe can reconcile these points of view by examining the frames of reference used. Let us concentrate on people in a car. Passengers instinctively use the car as a frame of reference, whereas a physicist might use Earth. The physicist might make this choice because Earth is nearly an inertial frame of reference, in which all forces have an identifiable physical origin. In such a frame of reference, Newtonâs laws of motion take the form given in\n\nNewtonâs Laws of Motion\n\n. The car is a\n\nnoninertial frame of reference\n\nbecause it is accelerated to the side. The force to the left sensed by car passengers is an\n\ninertial force\n\nhaving no physical origin (it is due purely to the inertia of the passenger, not to some physical cause such as tension, friction, or gravitation). The car, as well as the driver, is actually accelerating to the right.\n\nA physicist will choose whatever reference frame is most convenient for the situation being analyzed. There is no problem to a physicist in including inertial forces and Newtonâs second law, as usual, if that is more convenient, for example, on a merry-go-round or on a rotating planet. Noninertial (accelerated) frames of reference are used when it is useful to do so. Different frames of reference must be considered in discussing the motion of an astronaut in a spacecraft traveling at speeds near the speed of light, as you will appreciate in the study of the special theory of relativity.\n\nLet us now take a mental ride on a merry-go-roundâspecifically, a rapidly rotating playground merry-go-round (\n\nFigure 6.25\n\n). You take the merry-go-round to be your frame of reference because you rotate together. When rotating in that noninertial frame of reference, you feel an inertial force that tends to throw you off; this is often referred to as a\n\ncentrifugal force\n\n(not to be confused with centripetal force). Centrifugal force is a commonly used term, but it does not actually exist. You must hang on tightly to counteract your inertia (which people often refer to as centrifugal force). In Earthâs frame of reference, there is no force trying to throw you off; we emphasize that centrifugal force is a fiction. You must hang on to make yourself go in a circle because otherwise you would go in a straight line, right off the merry-go-round, in keeping with Newtonâs first law. But the force you exert acts toward the center of the circle.\n\nFigure\n\n6.25\n\n(a) A rider on a merry-go-round feels as if he is being thrown off. This inertial force is sometimes mistakenly called the centrifugal force in an effort to explain the riderâs motion in the rotating frame of reference. (b) In an inertial frame of reference and according to Newtonâs laws, it is his inertia that carries him off (the unshaded rider has\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=0{F}_{\\text{net}}=0$\n\nand heads in a straight line). A force,\n\n${F}_{\\text{centripetal}}{F}_{\\text{centripetal}}$\n\n, is needed to cause a circular path.\n\nThis inertial effect, carrying you away from the center of rotation if there is no centripetal force to cause circular motion, is put to good use in centrifuges (\n\nFigure 6.26\n\n). A\n\ncentrifuge\n\nspins a sample very rapidly, as mentioned earlier in this chapter. Viewed from the rotating frame of reference, the inertial force throws particles outward, hastening their sedimentation. The greater the angular velocity, the greater the centrifugal force. But what really happens is that the inertia of the particles carries them along a line tangent to the circle while the test tube is forced in a circular path by a centripetal force.\n\nFigure\n\n6.26\n\nCentrifuges use inertia to perform their task. Particles in the fluid sediment settle out because their inertia carries them away from the center of rotation. The large angular velocity of the centrifuge quickens the sedimentation. Ultimately, the particles come into contact with the test tube walls, which then supply the centripetal force needed to make them move in a circle of constant radius.\n\nLet us now consider what happens if something moves in a rotating frame of reference. For example, what if you slide a ball directly away from the center of the merry-go-round, as shown in\n\nFigure 6.27\n\n? The ball follows a straight path relative to Earth (assuming negligible friction) and a path curved to the right on the merry-go-roundâs surface. A person standing next to the merry-go-round sees the ball moving straight and the merry-go-round rotating underneath it. In the merry-go-roundâs frame of reference, we explain the apparent curve to the right by using an inertial force, called the\n\nCoriolis force\n\n, which causes the ball to curve to the right. The Coriolis force can be used by anyone in that frame of reference to explain why objects follow curved paths and allows us to apply Newtonâs laws in noninertial frames of reference.\n\nFigure\n\n6.27\n\nLooking down on the counterclockwise rotation of a merry-go-round, we see that a ball slid straight toward the edge follows a path curved to the right. The person slides the ball toward point\n\nB\n\n, starting at point\n\nA\n\n. Both points rotate to the shaded positions (\n\nA\n\nâ and\n\nB\n\nâ) shown in the time that the ball follows the curved path in the rotating frame and a straight path in Earthâs frame.\n\nUp until now, we have considered Earth to be an inertial frame of reference with little or no worry about effects due to its rotation. Yet such effects\n\ndo\n\nexistâin the rotation of weather systems, for example. Most consequences of Earthâs rotation can be qualitatively understood by analogy with the merry-go-round. Viewed from above the North Pole, Earth rotates counterclockwise, as does the merry-go-round in\n\nFigure 6.27\n\n. As on the merry-go-round, any motion in Earthâs Northern Hemisphere experiences a Coriolis force to the right. Just the opposite occurs in the Southern Hemisphere; there, the force is to the left. Because Earthâs angular velocity is small, the Coriolis force is usually negligible, but for large-scale motions, such as wind patterns, it has substantial effects.\n\nThe Coriolis force causes hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere to rotate in the counterclockwise direction, whereas tropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere rotate in the clockwise direction. (The terms hurricane, typhoon, and tropical storm are regionally specific names for cyclones, which are storm systems characterized by low pressure centers, strong winds, and heavy rains.)\n\nFigure 6.28\n\nhelps show how these rotations take place. Air flows toward any region of low pressure, and tropical cyclones contain particularly low pressures. Thus winds flow toward the center of a tropical cyclone or a low-pressure weather system at the surface. In the Northern Hemisphere, these inward winds are deflected to the right, as shown in the figure, producing a counterclockwise circulation at the surface for low-pressure zones of any type. Low pressure at the surface is associated with rising air, which also produces cooling and cloud formation, making low-pressure patterns quite visible from space. Conversely, wind circulation around high-pressure zones is clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere but is less visible because high pressure is associated with sinking air, producing clear skies.\n\nFigure\n\n6.28\n\n(a) The counterclockwise rotation of this Northern Hemisphere hurricane is a major consequence of the Coriolis force. (b) Without the Coriolis force, air would flow straight into a low-pressure zone, such as that found in tropical cyclones. (c) The Coriolis force deflects the winds to the right, producing a counterclockwise rotation. (d) Wind flowing away from a high-pressure zone is also deflected to the right, producing a clockwise rotation. (e) The opposite direction of rotation is produced by the Coriolis force in the Southern Hemisphere, leading to tropical cyclones. (credit a and credit e: modifications of work by NASA)\n\nThe rotation of tropical cyclones and the path of a ball on a merry-go-round can just as well be explained by inertia and the rotation of the system underneath. When noninertial frames are used, inertial forces, such as the Coriolis force, must be invented to explain the curved path. There is no identifiable physical source for these inertial forces. In an inertial frame, inertia explains the path, and no force is found to be without an identifiable source. Either view allows us to describe nature, but a view in an inertial frame is the simplest in the sense that all forces have origins and explanations."

You feel the drag force when you move your hand through water. You might also feel it if you move your hand during a strong wind. The faster you move your hand, the harder it is to move. You feel a smaller drag force when you tilt your hand so only the side goes through the airâyou have decreased the area of your hand that faces the direction of motion.\n\nDrag Forces\n\nLike friction, the\n\ndrag force\n\nalways opposes the motion of an object. Unlike simple friction, the drag force is proportional to some function of the velocity of the object in that fluid. This functionality is complicated and depends upon the shape of the object, its size, its velocity, and the fluid it is in. For most large objects such as cyclists, cars, and baseballs not moving too slowly, the magnitude of the drag force\n\n${F}_{\\text{D}}{F}_{\\text{D}}$\n\nis proportional to the square of the speed of the object. We can write this relationship mathematically as\n\n${F}_{\\text{D}}â{v}^{2}.{F}_{\\text{D}}â{v}^{2}.$\n\nWhen taking into account other factors, this relationship becomes\n\n${F}_{\\text{D}}=\\frac{1}{2}CÏA{v}^{2},{F}_{\\text{D}}=\\frac{1}{2}CÏA{v}^{2},$\n\n6.5\n\nwhere\n\nC\n\nis the drag coefficient,\n\nA\n\nis the area of the object facing the fluid, and\n\n$ÏÏ$\n\nis the density of the fluid. (Recall that density is mass per unit volume.) This equation can also be written in a more generalized fashion as\n\n${F}_{\\text{D}}=b{v}^{n},{F}_{\\text{D}}=b{v}^{n},$\n\nwhere\n\nb\n\nis a constant equivalent to\n\n$0.5CÏA.0.5CÏA.$\n\nWe have set the exponent\n\nn\n\nfor these equations as 2 because when an object is moving at high velocity through air, the magnitude of the drag force is proportional to the square of the speed.

Aerodynamic shaping of an automobile can reduce the drag force and thus increase a carâs gas mileage.\n\nFigure\n\n6.29\n\nFrom racing cars to bobsled racers, aerodynamic shaping is crucial to achieving top speeds. Bobsleds are designed for speed and are shaped like a bullet with tapered fins.

Notice that the drag coefficient is a dimensionless quantity. At highway speeds, over\n\n$50%50%$\n\nof the power of a car is used to overcome air drag. The most fuel-efficient cruising speed is about 70â80 km/h (about 45â50 mi/h). For this reason, during the 1970s oil crisis in the United States, maximum speeds on highways were set at about 90 km/h (55 mi/h).\n\nObject\n\nC\n\nAirfoil\n\n0.05\n\nToyota Camry\n\n0.28\n\nFord Focus\n\n0.32\n\nHonda Civic\n\n0.36\n\nFerrari Testarossa\n\n0.37\n\nDodge Ram Pickup\n\n0.43\n\nSphere\n\n0.45\n\nHummer H2 SUV\n\n0.64\n\nSkydiver (feet first)\n\n0.70\n\nBicycle\n\n0.90\n\nSkydiver (horizontal)\n\n1.0\n\nCircular flat plate\n\n1.12\n\nTable\n\n6.2\n\nTypical Values of Drag Coefficient\n\nC\n\nSubstantial research is under way in the sporting world to minimize drag. The dimples on golf balls are being redesigned, as are the clothes that athletes wear. Bicycle racers and some swimmers and runners wear full bodysuits. Australian Cathy Freeman wore a full body suit in the 2000 Sydney Olympics and won a gold medal in the 400-m race. Many swimmers in the 2008 Beijing Olympics wore (Speedo) body suits; it might have made a difference in breaking many world records (\n\nFigure 6.31\n\n). Most elite swimmers (and cyclists) shave their body hair. Such innovations can have the effect of slicing away milliseconds in a race, sometimes making the difference between a gold and a silver medal. One consequence is that careful and precise guidelines must be continuously developed to maintain the integrity of the sport.\n\nFigure\n\n6.31\n\nBody suits, such as this LZR Racer Suit, have been credited with aiding in many world records after their release in 2008.

(credit: NASA/Kathy Barnstorff)\n\nTerminal Velocity\n\nSome interesting situations connected to Newtonâs second law occur when considering the effects of drag forces upon a moving object. For instance, consider a skydiver falling through air under the influence of gravity. The two forces acting on him are the force of gravity and the drag force (ignoring the small buoyant force). The downward force of gravity remains constant regardless of the velocity at which the person is moving. However, as the personâs velocity increases, the magnitude of the drag force increases until the magnitude of the drag force is equal to the gravitational force, thus producing a net force of zero. A zero net force means that there is no acceleration, as shown by Newtonâs second law. At this point, the personâs velocity remains constant and we say that the person has reached his\n\nterminal velocity\n\n$({v}_{\\text{T}}).({v}_{\\text{T}}).$\n\nSince\n\n${F}_{\\text{D}}{F}_{\\text{D}}$\n\nis proportional to the speed squared, a heavier skydiver must go faster for\n\n${F}_{\\text{D}}{F}_{\\text{D}}$\n\nto equal his weight. Letâs see how this works out more quantitatively.\n\nAt the terminal velocity,\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=mgâ{F}_{\\text{D}}=ma=0.{F}_{\\text{net}}=mgâ{F}_{\\text{D}}=ma=0.$\n\nThus,\n\n$mg={F}_{\\text{D}}.mg={F}_{\\text{D}}.$\n\nUsing the equation for drag force, we have\n\n$mg=\\frac{1}{2}CÏA{v}_{\\text{T}}^{2}.mg=\\frac{1}{2}CÏA{v}_{\\text{T}}^{2}.$\n\nSolving for the velocity, we obtain\n\n${v}_{\\text{T}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2mg}{ÏCA}}.{v}_{\\text{T}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2mg}{ÏCA}}.$\n\nAssume the density of air is\n\n$Ï=1.21{\\text{kg/m}}^{3}.Ï=1.21{\\text{kg/m}}^{3}.$\n\nA 75-kg skydiver descending head first has a cross-sectional area of approximately\n\n$A=0.18{\\text{m}}^{2}A=0.18{\\text{m}}^{2}$\n\nand a drag coefficient of approximately\n\n$C=0.70C=0.70$\n\n. We find that\n\n${v}_{\\text{T}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2(75\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})}{(1.21{\\text{kg/m}}^{3})(0.70)(0.18{\\text{m}}^{2})}}=98\\text{m/s}=350\\text{km/h}\\text{.}{v}_{\\text{T}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2(75\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})}{(1.21{\\text{kg/m}}^{3})(0.70)(0.18{\\text{m}}^{2})}}=98\\text{m/s}=350\\text{km/h}\\text{.}$\n\nThis means a skydiver with a mass of 75 kg achieves a terminal velocity of about 350 km/h while traveling in a headfirst position, minimizing the area and his drag. In a spread-eagle position, that terminal velocity may decrease to about 200 km/h as the area increases. This terminal velocity becomes much smaller after the parachute opens.\n\nExample\n\n6.17\n\nTerminal Velocity of a Skydiver\n\nFind the terminal velocity of an 85-kg skydiver falling in a spread-eagle position. Assume that in the spread-eagle position, the diver has a cross-sectional area of\n\n$0.70{\\text{m}}^{2}0.70{\\text{m}}^{2}$\n\n.\n\nStrategy\n\nAt terminal velocity,\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=0.{F}_{\\text{net}}=0.$\n\nThus, the drag force on the skydiver must equal the force of gravity (the personâs weight). Using the equation of drag force, we find\n\n$mg=\\frac{1}{2}ÏCA{v}^{2}.mg=\\frac{1}{2}ÏCA{v}^{2}.$\n\nSolution\n\nThe terminal velocity\n\n${v}_{\\text{T}}{v}_{\\text{T}}$\n\ncan be written as\n\n${v}_{\\text{T}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2mg}{ÏCA}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2(85\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})}{(1.21{\\text{kg/m}}^{3})(1.0)(0.70{\\text{m}}^{2})}}=44\\text{m/s}\\text{.}{v}_{\\text{T}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2mg}{ÏCA}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{2(85\\text{kg})(9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2})}{(1.21{\\text{kg/m}}^{3})(1.0)(0.70{\\text{m}}^{2})}}=44\\text{m/s}\\text{.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nThis result is consistent with the value for\n\n${v}_{\\text{T}}{v}_{\\text{T}}$\n\nmentioned earlier. The 75-kg skydiver going feet first had a terminal velocity of\n\n${v}_{\\text{T}}=98\\text{m/s}\\text{.}{v}_{\\text{T}}=98\\text{m/s}\\text{.}$\n\nHe weighed less but had a smaller frontal area and so a smaller drag due to the air.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n6.10\n\nFind the terminal velocity of a 50-kg skydiver falling in spread-eagle fashion.\n\nThe size of the object that is falling through air presents another interesting application of air drag. If you fall from a 5-m-high branch of a tree, you will likely get hurtâpossibly fracturing a bone. However, a small squirrel does this all the time, without getting hurt. You do not reach a terminal velocity in such a short distance, but the squirrel does.\n\nThe following interesting quote on animal size and terminal velocity is from a 1928 essay by a British biologist, J. B. S. Haldane, titled âOn Being the Right Size.â\n\nâTo the mouse and any smaller animal, [gravity] presents practically no dangers. You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and, on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away, provided that the ground is fairly soft. A rat is killed, a man is broken, and a horse splashes. For the resistance presented to movement by the air is proportional to the surface of the moving object. Divide an animalâs length, breadth, and height each by ten; its weight is reduced to a thousandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So the resistance to falling in the case of the small animal is relatively ten times greater than the driving force.â\n\nThe above quadratic dependence of air drag upon velocity does not hold if the object is very small, is going very slow, or is in a denser medium than air. Then we find that the drag force is proportional just to the velocity. This relationship is given by Stokesâ law.\n\nStokesâ Law\n\nFor a spherical object falling in a medium, the drag force is\n\n${F}_{\\text{s}}=6ÏrÎ·v,{F}_{\\text{s}}=6ÏrÎ·v,$\n\n6.6\n\nwhere\n\nr\n\nis the radius of the object,\n\n$Î·Î·$\n\nis the viscosity of the fluid, and\n\nv\n\nis the objectâs velocity.\n\nGood examples of Stokesâ law are provided by microorganisms, pollen, and dust particles. Because each of these objects is so small, we find that many of these objects travel unaided only at a constant (terminal) velocity. Terminal velocities for bacteria (size about\n\n$1\\text{Î¼m})1\\text{Î¼m})$\n\ncan be about\n\n$2\\text{Î¼m/s}\\text{.}2\\text{Î¼m/s}\\text{.}$\n\nTo move at a greater speed, many bacteria swim using flagella (organelles shaped like little tails) that are powered by little motors embedded in the cell.\n\nSediment in a lake can move at a greater terminal velocity (about\n\n$5\\text{Î¼m/s}),5\\text{Î¼m/s}),$\n\nso it can take days for it to reach the bottom of the lake after being deposited on the surface.\n\nIf we compare animals living on land with those in water, you can see how drag has influenced evolution. Fish, dolphins, and even massive whales are streamlined in shape to reduce drag forces. Birds are streamlined and migratory species that fly large distances often have particular features such as long necks. Flocks of birds fly in the shape of a spearhead as the flock forms a streamlined pattern (\n\nFigure 6.32\n\n). In humans, one important example of streamlining is the shape of sperm, which need to be efficient in their use of energy.\n\nFigure\n\n6.32\n\nGeese fly in a V formation during their long migratory travels. This shape reduces drag and energy consumption for individual birds, and also allows them a better way to communicate.

The objects are placed in a uniform airstream created by a fan. Calculate the drag coefficient.\n\nThe Calculus of Velocity-Dependent Frictional Forces\n\nWhen a body slides across a surface, the frictional force on it is approximately constant and given by\n\n${Î¼}_{\\text{k}}N.{Î¼}_{\\text{k}}N.$\n\nUnfortunately, the frictional force on a body moving through a liquid or a gas does not behave so simply. This drag force is generally a complicated function of the bodyâs velocity. However, for a body moving in a straight line at moderate speeds through a liquid such as water, the frictional force can often be approximated by\n\n${f}_{R}=\\text{â}bv,{f}_{R}=\\text{â}bv,$\n\nwhere\n\nb\n\nis a constant whose value depends on the dimensions and shape of the body and the properties of the liquid, and\n\nv\n\nis the velocity of the body. Two situations for which the frictional force can be represented by this equation are a motorboat moving through water and a small object falling slowly through a liquid.\n\nLetâs consider the object falling through a liquid. The free-body diagram of this object with the positive direction downward is shown in\n\nFigure 6.33\n\n. Newtonâs second law in the vertical direction gives the differential equation\n\n$mgâbv=m\\frac{dv}{dt},mgâbv=m\\frac{dv}{dt},$\n\nwhere we have written the acceleration as\n\n$dv\\text{/}dt.dv\\text{/}dt.$\n\nAs\n\nv\n\nincreases, the frictional force â\n\nbv\n\nincreases until it matches\n\nmg\n\n.

The boat then slows down under the frictional force\n\n${f}_{R}=\\text{â}bv.{f}_{R}=\\text{â}bv.$\n\n(a) What are the velocity and position of the boat as functions of time? (b) If the boat slows down from 4.0 to 1.0 m/s in 10 s, how far does it travel before stopping?\n\nSolution\n\nWith the motor stopped, the only horizontal force on the boat is\n\n${f}_{R}=\\text{â}bv,{f}_{R}=\\text{â}bv,$\n\nso from Newtonâs second law,\n\n$m\\frac{dv}{dt}=\\text{â}bv,m\\frac{dv}{dt}=\\text{â}bv,$\n\nwhich we can write as\n\n$\\frac{dv}{v}=â\\frac{b}{m}dt.\\frac{dv}{v}=â\\frac{b}{m}dt.$\n\nIntegrating this equation between the time zero when the velocity is\n\n${v}_{0}{v}_{0}$\n\nand the time\n\nt\n\nwhen the velocity is\n\n$vv$\n\n, we have\n\n${â«}_{0}^{v}\\frac{d{v}^{â²}}{{v}^{â²}}=â\\frac{b}{m}{â«}_{0}^{t}d{t}^{â²}.{â«}_{0}^{v}\\frac{d{v}^{â²}}{{v}^{â²}}=â\\frac{b}{m}{â«}_{0}^{t}d{t}^{â²}.$\n\nThus,\n\n$\\text{ln}\\frac{v}{{v}_{0}}=â\\frac{b}{m}t,\\text{ln}\\frac{v}{{v}_{0}}=â\\frac{b}{m}t,$\n\nwhich, since\n\n$\\text{ln}A=x\\text{implies}{e}^{x}=A,\\text{ln}A=x\\text{implies}{e}^{x}=A,$\n\nwe can write this as\n\n$v={v}_{0}{e}^{\\text{â}bt\\text{/}m}.v={v}_{0}{e}^{\\text{â}bt\\text{/}m}.$\n\nNow from the definition of velocity,\n\n$\\frac{dx}{dt}={v}_{0}{e}^{\\text{â}bt\\text{/}m},\\frac{dx}{dt}={v}_{0}{e}^{\\text{â}bt\\text{/}m},$\n\nso we have\n\n$dx={v}_{0}{e}^{\\text{â}bt\\text{/}m}dt.dx={v}_{0}{e}^{\\text{â}bt\\text{/}m}dt.$\n\nWith the initial position zero, we have\n\n${â«}_{0}^{x}dx'={v}_{0}{â«}_{0}^{t}{e}^{\\text{â}bt'\\text{/}m}dt',{â«}_{0}^{x}dx'={v}_{0}{â«}_{0}^{t}{e}^{\\text{â}bt'\\text{/}m}dt',$\n\nand\n\n${x=â\\frac{m{v}_{0}}{b}{e}^{\\text{â}bt'\\text{/}m}|}_{0}^{t}=\\frac{m{v}_{0}}{b}(1â{e}^{\\text{â}bt\\text{/}m}).{x=â\\frac{m{v}_{0}}{b}{e}^{\\text{â}bt'\\text{/}m}|}_{0}^{t}=\\frac{m{v}_{0}}{b}(1â{e}^{\\text{â}bt\\text{/}m}).$\n\nAs time increases,\n\n${e}^{\\text{â}bt\\text{/}m}â0,{e}^{\\text{â}bt\\text{/}m}â0,$\n\nand the position of the boat approaches a limiting value\n\n${x}_{\\text{max}}=\\frac{m{v}_{0}}{b}.{x}_{\\text{max}}=\\frac{m{v}_{0}}{b}.$\n\nAlthough this tells us that the boat takes an infinite amount of time to reach\n\n${x}_{\\text{max}},{x}_{\\text{max}},$\n\nthe boat effectively stops after a reasonable time. For example, at\n\n$t=10m\\text{/}b,t=10m\\text{/}b,$\n\nwe have\n\n$v={v}_{0}{e}^{â10}â4.5Ã{10}^{â5}{v}_{0},v={v}_{0}{e}^{â10}â4.5Ã{10}^{â5}{v}_{0},$\n\nwhereas we also have\n\n$x={x}_{\\text{max}}(1â{e}^{â10})â0.99995{x}_{\\text{max}}.x={x}_{\\text{max}}(1â{e}^{â10})â0.99995{x}_{\\text{max}}.$\n\nTherefore, the boatâs velocity and position have essentially reached their final values.\n\nWith\n\n${v}_{0}=4.0\\text{m/s}{v}_{0}=4.0\\text{m/s}$\n\nand\n\n$v=1.0\\text{m/s,}v=1.0\\text{m/s,}$\n\nwe have\n\n$1.0\\text{m/s}=(4.0\\text{m/s}){e}^{\\text{â}(b\\text{/}m)(10\\text{s})},1.0\\text{m/s}=(4.0\\text{m/s}){e}^{\\text{â}(b\\text{/}m)(10\\text{s})},$\n\nso\n\n$\\text{ln}0.25=\\text{â}\\text{ln}4.0=â\\frac{b}{m}(10\\text{s}),\\text{ln}0.25=\\text{â}\\text{ln}4.0=â\\frac{b}{m}(10\\text{s}),$\n\nand\n\n$\\frac{b}{m}=\\frac{1}{10}\\text{ln}4.0{\\text{s}}^{\\text{-1}}=0.14{\\text{s}}^{\\text{-1}}\\text{.}\\frac{b}{m}=\\frac{1}{10}\\text{ln}4.0{\\text{s}}^{\\text{-1}}=0.14{\\text{s}}^{\\text{-1}}\\text{.}$\n\nNow the boatâs limiting position is\n\n${x}_{\\text{max}}=\\frac{m{v}_{0}}{b}=\\frac{4.0\\text{m/s}}{0.14{\\text{s}}^{\\text{â1}}}=29\\text{m}\\text{.}{x}_{\\text{max}}=\\frac{m{v}_{0}}{b}=\\frac{4.0\\text{m/s}}{0.14{\\text{s}}^{\\text{â1}}}=29\\text{m}\\text{.}$\n\nSignificance\n\nIn the both of the previous examples, we found âlimitingâ values. The terminal velocity is the same as the limiting velocity, which is the velocity of the falling object after a (relatively) long time has passed. Similarly, the limiting distance of the boat is the distance the boat will travel after a long amount of time has passed. Due to the properties of exponential decay, the time involved to reach either of these values is actually not too long (certainly not an infinite amount of time!) but they are quickly found by taking the limit to infinity.\n\nCheck Your Understanding\n\n6.11\n\nSuppose the resistive force of the air on a skydiver can be approximated by\n\n$f=\\text{â}b{v}^{2}f=\\text{â}b{v}^{2}$\n\n. If the terminal velocity of a 100-kg skydiver is 60 m/s, what is the value of b?"

Explain, considering especially that tape can stick to vertical walls and even to ceilings.\n\n3\n\n.\n\nWhen you learn to drive, you discover that you need to let up slightly on the brake pedal as you come to a stop or the car will stop with a jerk. Explain this in terms of the relationship between static and kinetic friction.\n\n4\n\n.\n\nWhen you push a piece of chalk across a chalkboard, it sometimes screeches because it rapidly alternates between slipping and sticking to the board. Describe this process in more detail, in particular, explaining how it is related to the fact that kinetic friction is less than static friction. (The same slip-grab process occurs when tires screech on pavement.)\n\n5\n\n.\n\nA physics major is cooking breakfast when she notices that the frictional force between her steel spatula and Teflon frying pan is only 0.200 N. Knowing the coefficient of kinetic friction between the two materials, she quickly calculates the normal force.

Explain.\n\n7\n\n.\n\nDefine centripetal force. Can any type of force (for example, tension, gravitational force, friction, and so on) be a centripetal force? Can any combination of forces be a centripetal force?\n\n8\n\n.\n\nIf centripetal force is directed toward the center, why do you feel that you are âthrownâ away from the center as a car goes around a curve? Explain.\n\n9\n\n.\n\nRace car drivers routinely cut corners, as shown below (Path 2). Explain how this allows the curve to be taken at the greatest speed.\n\n10\n\n.\n\nMany amusement parks have rides that make vertical loops like the one shown below. For safety, the cars are attached to the rails in such a way that they cannot fall off. If the car goes over the top at just the right speed, gravity alone will supply the centripetal force.

Would the direction of rotation reverse if water were forced up the drain?\n\n17\n\n.\n\nA car rounds a curve and encounters a patch of ice with a very low coefficient of kinetic fiction. The car slides off the road. Describe the path of the car as it leaves the road.\n\n18\n\n.\n\nIn one amusement park ride, riders enter a large vertical barrel and stand against the wall on its horizontal floor. The barrel is spun up and the floor drops away. Riders feel as if they are pinned to the wall by a force something like the gravitational force. This is an inertial force sensed and used by the riders to explain events in the rotating frame of reference of the barrel. Explain in an inertial frame of reference (Earth is nearly one) what pins the riders to the wall, and identify all forces acting on them.\n\n19\n\n.\n\nTwo friends are having a conversation. Anna says a satellite in orbit is in free fall because the satellite keeps falling toward Earth. Tom says a satellite in orbit is not in free fall because the acceleration due to gravity is not\n\n$9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2}9.80{\\text{m/s}}^{2}$\n\n.

    "content": "Summary\n\n6.1\n\nSolving Problems with Newtonâs Laws\n\nNewtonâs laws of motion can be applied in numerous situations to solve motion problems.\n\nSome problems contain multiple force vectors acting in different directions on an object. Be sure to draw diagrams, resolve all force vectors into horizontal and vertical components, and draw a free-body diagram. Always analyze the direction in which an object accelerates so that you can determine whether\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=ma{F}_{\\text{net}}=ma$\n\nor\n\n${F}_{\\text{net}}=0.{F}_{\\text{net}}=0.$\n\nThe normal force on an object is not always equal in magnitude to the weight of the object. If an object is accelerating vertically, the normal force is less than or greater than the weight of the object. Also, if the object is on an inclined plane, the normal force is always less than the full weight of the object.\n\nSome problems contain several physical quantities, such as forces, acceleration, velocity, or position. You can apply concepts from kinematics and dynamics to solve these problems.\n\n6.2\n\nFriction\n\nFriction is a contact force that opposes the motion or attempted motion between two systems. Simple friction is proportional to the normal force\n\nN\n\nsupporting the two systems.\n\nThe magnitude of static friction force between two materials stationary relative to each other is determined using the coefficient of static friction, which depends on both materials.\n\nThe kinetic friction force between two materials moving relative to each other is determined using the coefficient of kinetic friction, which also depends on both materials and is always less than the coefficient of static friction.\n\n6.3\n\nCentripetal Force\n\nCentripetal force\n\n${Fâ}_{\\text{c}}{Fâ}_{\\text{c}}$\n\nis a âcenter-seekingâ force that always points toward the center of rotation. It is perpendicular to linear velocity and has the magnitude\n\n${F}_{\\text{c}}=m{a}_{\\text{c}}.{F}_{\\text{c}}=m{a}_{\\text{c}}.$\n\nRotating and accelerated frames of reference are noninertial. Inertial forces, such as the Coriolis force, are needed to explain motion in such frames.\n\n6.4\n\nDrag Force and Terminal Speed\n\nDrag forces acting on an object moving in a fluid oppose the motion. For larger objects (such as a baseball) moving at a velocity in air, the drag force is determined using the drag coefficient (typical values are given in\n\nTable 6.2\n\n), the area of the object facing the fluid, and the fluid density.\n\nFor small objects (such as a bacterium) moving in a denser medium (such as water), the drag force is given by Stokesâ law."
